Boom , boom ... 
I guess they call you Cal , huh ? 
Help me . 
How about , " Really , very sad " ? 
My stomach ...

And I would have what is mine . 
You 're gonna kill him . 
I don 't think I 've ever been this hung-over . 
What if it was your daughter ?

This isn 't the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry . 
What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon ? 
And it was you , Zoe . 
I thought that once I had some proof ... 
I can make it . 
Me too . 
Clean hole . 
And you think this is the target . 
Vader . 
You 're one person , Em . 
I 'm going straight . 
The entire bible is mostly myth and allegory 
Paul , I don 't like it any more than you do . 
Every step is a mammoth effort . 
If Homeland knows where we 're at ... 
Do you always bring your work home with you ? 
Car accident , l 'm fine . 
You probably all have your dresses . 
He paid cash . 
You are a Tiger . 
What do you want ? 
I thought this kind of stuff made you sick . 
I didn 't see you there . 
Oh . 
Aren 't you here because you like giving it to young men ? 
They mean you care about something . 
I 'm sorry , sweetie , but you know how this works . 
I counted them by the light through the hatch door and Adam 's visits . 
This whole thing ... 
So , um ... 
You 're either very brave or very ... very foolish . 
I want to run it past a source . 
Think I might . 
Alicia was one of them . 
She 's your very soul . 
- Give us a hand . 
Where you heading ? 
( MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) 
Betrayal was the only thing that felt real to me . 
It was really bad before Rio and now it 's even worse . 
It was a miracle . 
You 're scared to get out on your own . 
Miss you , sweetie . 
Yes , it was . 
For I was the one they called Sleeping Beauty . 
Your Zen-like calm ? 
The drugs I took seemed to light up my brain . 
You said something before about laying him to rest . 
I 've seen this before . 
It was my fault . 
Jesus Christ . 
Then let 's get right to it , shall we ? 
Yeah , bust them trees . 
Not everybody gets to run away , you know . 
We can 't . 
Go into the commercial shrimping business and call myself Captain Dunk . 
Five alarm blaze on Commercial . 
Sorry , I wasn 't sure if you wanted me to get ... 
All right , like to start with a few basic questions . 
I suspect someone 
We got no place left to go . 
Is that you flying through space ? 
Can you do this one for less ? 
Do you ? 
Look at her 
Now , what about the bakery ? 
It 's urgent . 
# ' Cause I don 't stand a chance ... # 
Not again . 
- So ? 
So that bastard took my car . 
I hope so . 
I knew it . 
- All right , let 's eat . 
We need to get the engines back online . 
Now I know . 
Wait , wait , wait . 
Dad , how did you know ? 
I did . 
Do not let them see her . 
- Yeah , I can . 
- Dad , the thing is ... 
Be smart . 
- You don 't validate ? 
If you can 't help , you will be sorry . 
What 's that supposed to mean ? 
Counting cards is a foolproof system . 
I hope you 've enjoyed your time travel experience . 
Where 'd you get the Mirakuru ? 
Baby , there 's no streak . 
It 's my shortcut from the woods . 
It 's very light . 
Do you have an understanding or commitment on when you guys are going to press with the first stories ? 
I 'm sorry , I just don 't see it . 
- We 've lost the lateral controls . 
Working here has given me a pretty good knowledge of how to kill and how to get away with it . 
I know how people think . 
You know , just treat me like I 'm not dying . 
Agent L. Hobbs . 
I suppose we could have locked her up and thrown away the key . 
What the fuck is that ? 
We can 't let Quinn have control of this . 
Our goals are still the same . 
Big Teddy , kneecapped , button men . 
Me thinks he doth protest too much . 
Might spend a year or 20 in jail . 
One thing you should know about my brother , he 's very stubborn . 
Chief says send the bus to 1381 Elk . 
Vulcans cannot lie . 
Hey , Grandpa , what the hell was the delay back there ? 
Not a chance . 
So you 're never gonna catch him with a camcorder . 
Well , go get it ! 
And then there was the water . 
You need to feel around in there and find the bullet . 
- No , actually- - 
Awesomely , my brother . 
The answer is here somewhere . 
as you seem to believe , you 've done this before , then turning the lights on should not be any problem , should it ? 
You ungrateful bitch . 
Vermin ? 
Not yet . 
Just listen to me for a second . 
He may be right , but he won 't do anything about it . 
My Lord , 
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ! 
- Quit calling me that . 
Just stay safe . 
The whole vibe is so Yountville . 
Where 's larry ? 
Spider-Pig , Spider-Pig . 
We have our own beasts in here . 
They came bearing gifts . 
They used chainsaws to cut them up ! 
Give up , Miss Bertinelli . 
Slade ? 
Where are you going ? 
What was your plan ? 
There 's a private screening of my new movie , 
Why didn 't he save Nago ? 
Heard you guys got the bar fight kill . 
Go check the bathroom has already been there . 
You know , instead of bleeding me dry , you could do something about the noise in there ! 
She 's 18 years old , and her skin never got the sun , 
- Oh , mother of all things . 
What are you talking about ? 
Yeah , but in this case , someone actually turned up dead . 
How long was I out ? 
- We 're the new locals . 
We should have heard from her . 
If she sold the rights , all this would go away , leaving you with nothing . 
Who cares ? 
Changed his name . 
He 's already on his fourth cup of coffee . 
- Right . 
Except for the part where I have the gun . 
Yes , status on my torpedo ? 
What a wonderful surprise . 
And has offered me transportation while I 'm out . 
I was just thinking about Rita , how much ... 
Militia threatening and extorting money from civilians . 
She would sleep with anyone who wasn 't her husband . 
Tell me who you are . 
Don 't you want to tell him yourself ? 
You can be as open and honest as you wanna be . 
- Would you take those off ? 
You 'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock . 
Give me your knife . 
I 'm not saying you would do such a thing deliberately . 
The sun . 
Ah , dammit , I got to roll . 
Mrs. Gaines , where were you at 11 : 00 the night your husband was murdered ? 
If used on a public space , office blocks , schools ... 
Would you describe exactly what you saw ? 
- Books , magazines . 
Daddy , where are we going ? 
We can 't afford to wait that long . 
Nothing , just ... we 're the 562 playgroup . 
What you doing ? 
What the hell 's going on here , Charley ? 
Maybe it doesn 't make a difference , but it 's comforting to know we 're in the next room . 
Is that what you want ? 
My name is Simone . 
Harold Dresden 's wife is sick . 
Crazy Craig Koons . 
Not if we get to her first . 
And I 'm looking a missing colleague . 
I would 've enjoyed that . 
No , we want a professional police detective . 
- Where did you find them ? 
You 're thinking the whip was the worst I could do ? 
But do you wanna know the best part ? 
Oh , what the fuck ? 
We have to call the police . 
What 's Dallas 's deal , man ? 
The garage . 
Help me ! 
Help me ! 
If he comes at you again 
Anyone with a camera 's gonna be pretty hard to miss . 
Don 't look at the cameras . 
Nice to meet you . 
I guess you don 't know who you can trust , huh ? 
I spent it . 
Otherwise it 's ... 
And what you said , I mean ... 
Did begging help when he tore you ? 
I see . 
Don 't worry . 
- Hey . 
Okay , lets go . 
- Yes . 
The sheriff called you deputy . 
You trying to jump-start him or kill him ? 
It appears you 're too small for the big kind . 
There 's 60 minutes in an hour , 60 seconds in a minute . 
Now , I asked for the specifications , but he said ... 
Turn comrades against each other . 
Okay , well , they 're bigger than me . 
I need you to understand- - 
- And I never will ! 
I got a bad feeling about this . 
You don 't fucking understand , do you ? 
I wasn 't talking to you . 
Remember our deal . 
It is very powerful ! 
It can . 
Look at you , Sutter . 
I drove the car . 
Go . 
Go start the truck . 
No , god gave me such a beautiful daughter , and I want to show the world how special you are . 
Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol , we 've never been closer . 
And anyone else ? 
Are you guys just saying monopoly stuff ? 
Maybe it 's a warning . 
What 's up ? 
And I will forget I that ever met you . 
I just ... 
Laugh it up . 
- You 're gonna crash it ? 
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister . 
I remember that Shigeru said someting similar before he died . 
All right , listen up ! 
Step aside , mister . 
- I 'd be surprised if he 's here for the food . 
We were all struck by that lightning . 
- Help us , please . 
One moment , please . 
About what you said the other day . 
Morning , sir . 
- A meteor , for real . 
I can row ! 
I could go check it out . 
Keep moving , Jack . 
Just go ! 
A tragedy . 
Moscow Jew boy ! 
So Billy was so busy , he couldn 't spend the weekend with his three oldest friends in the world . 
Agent Astrid Farnsworth . 
Got a report of a possible security breach . 
John , what is up , huh ? 
she 's nesting . 
No , I 'm just looking for some people . 
I never thought ... 
Come here . 
One place . 
My attorney contacted her on my behalf , yes . 
The name 's Mace . 
Oh , yeah . 
While I 'm gone , you 're welcome to stay here . 
The uniform for family . 
Why save you ? 
Hey , kids . 
He used the onboard computer as an access point to upload a really nasty worm . 
It was lovely to meet you two chaps . 
What 'd Dori do ? 
It 's just a huge mistake , 
- What ? 
Your husband is missing . 
This right here has only have about two weeks left . 
Just ... 
" They don 't understand you ? " 
What lies within her appears to be one of them . 
It 's time I ate some of this food I paid for . 
By giving up so much to come here 
- All the station woulïve done is send you . 
Just keep it . 
Tell you what ? 
I want to . 
Thunder 11 tally three targets . 
I 'm trying to tell you that your life is in danger . 
- Wait , shh , shh . 
You sound like an old man , Dad . 
I wouldn 't get caught . 
- Is she allergic to any medication ? 
And even though you don 't wish to own me ... 
Handing each other awards for cartoons and pornography . 
It 's just ahead . 
But we could do anything we want . 
Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
You went through my jacket ? 
You mean kill people . 
Sandra said it has been calculated there more 
Angie 's been pulling the news footage of his house on the night of the killing . 
It 's just a matter of time . 
You do this , and you 're throwing your life away . 
I think you should fight him . 
They want his name . 
But I 'm asking you because you 're the only one I can ask . 
What I 'm saying is , is outside the military , there 's maybe four people that know exactly how this place runs . 
We pulled out some sweet-ass biscuits for today . 
What do you think , Hank ? 
Kind of tires you out . 
The Rangers are dead . 
But maybe Banalandju 's eye would be too sharp . 
I 'm sorry . 
I don 't want you to spend your life waiting . 
I really had to think , how much do I want to know about this . 
How that happened has to be a matter of record . 
All right . 
Nobody seems to talk about that . 
Or stop some armed thieves , I 'm gonna do it . 
There are nine realms . 
And he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged . 
Call me if you need me . 
The Mirakuru . 
My God . 
Kill ! 
Hey . 
What is the big fucking deal ? 
I even went down to the clinic , did you know that ? 
Damn , it 's hot out here . 
I ... 
Oh , stop sign , Alex . 
I 'm on site . 
It 'll never work . 
I could handle the Freelancers coming after me , but not the two of you . 
It wasn 't my first time . 
Ten thousand kilometers and Closing . 
There 's cameras there , so you 're gonna have to cut the central feed . 
Was anything reported stolen ? 
Archibald Snatcher , you 've finally done it ! 
Prince Alcott , I have a proposition for you . 
It 's an anomaly - - an irregularity . 
Welcome to the Eye . 
You , Samurai ! 
Betray him , and I 'll kill you . 
" Then we 'll have fun ! 
But you look kind of lost out here , Terney . 
I was in the battle at Blackwater . 
This is ridiculous . 
He hasn 't seen it . 
I broke my ribs . 
How do you know us , Alec ? 
Neal , the coffee shop 's outside . 
Prepare to jump to those coordinates . 
I took it out kayaking , you know ? 
It 's actually just the opposite . 
- Looks like the whole city 's evacuating . 
You 're right . 
Come on , come on , come on ! 
Are you hurt ? 
You are that pebble ... 
I haven 't got a chance to hack it . 
Now prepare for a night of unparalleled passion . 
Oh , no . 
Chad , let him go . 
What 's that on your back ? 
My mom , she used to slur her words and get all chatty . 
( SCOFFS ) What are you talking about ? 
She is expected to address the attack on the white house that ended an hour ago in a startling rescue . 
l couldn 't bear it if she didn 't 
What are you doing here ? 
Hey , Dave , 
You wanna tell me what this is about ? 
What 's your total ? 
That 's the image that 's getting uploaded to the wires . 
They had guns ? 
His music demands a certain quality of application . 
You think I 'm pretty ? 
Then wrap it up . 
- Doesn 't matter . 
That 's my job . 
Show me Elsa . 
And this will all be a little clearer when I give you something back . 
Do you know where Dr. Farragut and Dr. Walker went ? 
Hello . 
But I never had my guts drained out of me . 
The search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight . 
The buses are waiting for you . 
- Perhaps . 
Clock 's ticking . 
Agency runs on secrecy . 
Now you 're talking . 
There 's no air in here . 
Didn 't you see them hightail it out of here ? 
From what ? 
He 's younger than he looks . 
Come on , he did what you asked , he apologized . 
The shah has side sickness . 
Harmless , huh ? 
That I 'm the jerk . 
Which T-Bag has . 
Because I was loaded , okay ? 
Now , unfortunately , this one is the model , so ... 
Who are you to say that to me ? 
Can we talk about that later ? 
Yeah , I loaned it to my friend last week , so ... must be hers . 
You had my cell number . 
Yes , of course . 
I knew him . 
- LAX , let 's go ! 
Someone get me out . 
You shouldn 't say " bitch . " 
This way , we have a fighting chance . 
- That 's no excuse ! 
Dig in . 
These rebel Celts need to be dealt with once and for all . 
I 'm not interested in getting into a war here . 
He 's gone ! 
Momentary relief from the , uh , tragedy of everyday living . 
That was two operatives obeying orders . 
It ' s hot . 
Spying feels kind of wrong . 
They will find you . 
He is made of adamantium , just like you . 
- Shane ! 
That is a signal . 
Insurance . 
- Okay . 
And when we say uncensored , that means you get to see some of us naked . 
Mid to high-end bottle of ... 
I 'll get the wheelchair . 
I 'm not saying for a full meal , we 're just gonna eat appeteasers . 
But I 'm sure you 'll find out . 
Feel free to return the favor . 
Good news is there 's hope for you , private . 
You , on the other hand , look pooped . 
How did you get out there ? 
That 's the guy they want you to fight ? 
He 'd just wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming . 
Sit tight , I 'll be in Atlanta in a minute . 
Do ? 
- You see that , too ? 
CARRIE : 
Anybody call for me on the phone ? 
Island dangerous , but you not tell them where to find me . 
I 'm glad you 're here . 
The feeling was indescribable . 
Invigorating . 
What are we gonna do ? 
- I didn 't think I could do it alone . 
We 're picking up ionization from the upper atmosphere . 
I 'm not staying there . 
Now I 'm at the station ... 
I 've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday , and Nat and Cam are coming over . 
But no ... you said Rue de I ... 
All right . 
I 'm not going to let her hurt you again . 
- Nothing . 
A new low . 
All I wanna do is put eyes on my son , Joss . 
So you noticed , a tiny fraction of your stash went missing ? 
We 're here about Wyck Theissens . 
A prostitute in Taipei , sir . 
Chappie doesn 't want fears ! 
I 'm going back to the car . 
You must be mistaking me for someone else . 
Freedom of Information Act . 
We just need the two of you to come up with a brain that can control everything . 
Misty 's probably twirled her way to the Everglades by now . 
That was a hard right hand immediately after the bell . 
The man 's got some soul . 
No ! 
Then what ? 
Mr. Graham . 
How much antibiotic do we have left ? 
Are you hurt ? 
But you shouldn 't associate with the Kuraghin set and their way of life . 
It 's very disorientating . 
You can do that river stones thing . 
All right , I want a nice clean dispersal this time . 
You 're dealing drugs , weapons and children . 
Squeaks . 
What kind ? 
Who wants a fight ? 
- I felt that . 
Ten o 'clock ! 
Now I 'm familiar with somebody who may help you . 
What do you mean , you want a divorce ? 
We 'll get you settled . 
Everyone in for a buck . 
Am I right ? 
Now , come on out of there and put your hands out in front of you . 
To my time . 
Well , you definitely wanna maintain residency in your actual home . 
Do you really think this guy was killed over math ? 
And I lied and I said that my name was Lena . 
Hurrying , my lady . 
Now sit back , relax and enjoy the season finale of Where the Bears Are Season 2 . 
That 's all your fault , how come you didn 't tell me about Kenji ? 
Okay , so I slept with a guy on the first date , and alicia 's pregnant . 
And after you agreed to do it , 
Uh , well , it would seem that a Virgin Mary has appeared ... in the syrup of a local man 's pancake . 
Hey , Mitch . 
Visions of death . 
Do you remember that ? 
It can wait . 
Gonna be the same whenever you try it . 
Do let me know when you decide to start aging , won 't you ? 
Was that a yes ? 
- That 's how I feel . 
I would say yes . 
Hey , they check you for rabies ? 
Do not ever do that to me again , Babe . 
If he doesn 't , then y 'all have a serious problem . 
And start looking into career alternatives . 
The Realm , My Lord . 
Honey , what happened ? 
Hey , I 'm your sponsor . 
Look , Jacq . 
Of what country was Albert Einstein ... offered the presidency in 1952 ? 
Because I want you to feel the way that I feel right now . 
Yeah , but you don 't . 
My clients pride themselves on anonymity . 
Well , I guess I should make that " Huntress . " 
- Sold out . 
- Would , too . 
Let 's have a look ! 
It 's like someone moved the mouse , except neither one of us did . 
No , it was Jim . 
Jack , you work too hard . 
That vital committee which coordinates all our security measures ? 
You talk too much . 
Hear that ? 
- A prefect at your age ? 
- Thanks . 
She 's gonna be okay . 
Boy need his rest . 
If he killed Natasha , then we 've got him . 
Perhaps one who has some experience in these matters . 
It 's going to take some time to explain , sir . 
- Me ? 
l don 't care what it costs or what you need . 
Is the capital roaring ? 
White tiger . 
- It wasn 't . 
And he was perfect ! 
Not before it took a piece of my leg with it . 
I can 't get around your mirror . 
Eddie had three sisters . 
She died outside a state of grace . 
Like , a date ? 
Haven 't seen you since the divorce . 
But how ? 
Are you out of your mind ? 
As well as being her lawyer , she also did the accounting . 
I 'm going to a job interview in Italy . 
We were coworkers and friends . 
Suddenly , he 's a saint . 
Finding God changed him . 
No , I 'm not sure I do . 
Hey ! 
Honey , you 're overreacting . 
He was a sophomore volunteering for psych experiments . 
This is Agent Peters . 
What happened ? 
YEARBOOKS TODAY ! 
I gotta go speak to Caren . 
Well , it don 't matter . 
I 'll convey your thoughts to Bartholomew . 
Have you located our quarry , Mr. Reese ? 
There 's loyalty , and then there 's stupidity . 
Thank you , Anil . 
I need the truth , Brody . 
You just said you had a choice to make in that car . 
Really , Walt . 
I 'm giving you a chance . 
That I hadn 't known before 
I am very sorry about your friend Craig . 
- Ender ... 
That would be play . 
And don 't ever touch Cami again . 
Where on Highway 50 ? 
There ? 
It 's good joke , yes ? 
You do realize that , don 't you ? 
How are you gonna fit through that ? 
Are you going to go through with it ? 
A war that Earth could get draw into . 
I can 't . 
John du Pont is a mentor to me . 
About 50 years from now . 
My daughter passed four years ago . 
What do you say ? 
- She 's cute . 
" Appear " ? 
Course ... by ... course 
What 's your name ? 
Long sheet , lot of violent felonies . 
I never said a word . 
No , they--they weren 't lies . 
- Bye , bye , bye . 
In about an hour . 
Saul 's not calling the shots here . 
Then , I met her in the store and she showed me the new pair of gloves she just bought . 
I 'm glad you 're starting to remember . 
Well , I think we vote for ourselves , right ? 
♪ And my legacy will endure 
But , you know , she 's not a little girl anymore . 
I 'm gonna save you a lot of pain . 
She 's gonna be fine . 
Get the fuck out of my office . 
Now , you think you can make it back ? 
That 's Good . 
Actually , you know what ? 
He came into my cabin and he had a gun . 
Doesn 't look like she 's got a drop of blood left . 
I remember . 
Yeah . 
But do it how you do it . 
- Monk . 
- Come here , boy ! 
I have just ensured we will have peace . 
I 'm sarah . 
Age-old tradition with new sensation . 
I want to go . 
Balian to the Rangers . 
Burning Freddie Lounds wasn 't his first effigy . 
You know , you weren 't even a good blowjob . 
We 're gonna handle it . 
Wait , the traveller 's already here so ... 
You know John , I feel like we have gotten off on the wrong foot . 
Or filibuster it . 
We don 't have a choice . 
- It 's the world , dear . 
- Link , where am I ? 
There 's still a chance that prime minister matobo will be recovered . 
Don 't do anything rash . 
Or are you just trying to get this guy to tell you where his camp is ? 
Pinocchio ! 
Where are my lights ? 
- Samedi . 
Forgive us if we don 't agree . 
Ed did , three days ago , for the last time . 
Bring the whole family to the crappiest place on earth . 
Goodbye , Jacob . 
Cyrus is safer with me . 
I 'm sorry . 
You got us caught , now you 're gonna get us killed , ' cause you ... 
Well , what does he want ? 
What then ? 
I am Senator Quintas Attius Corvus ! 
American ? 
It 's an original FBI fingerprinting kit . 
That 's a pretty random question . 
Well , maybe we can pull a print . 
- Rorge . 
Now let 's not dwell on the past . 
Finch , he 's in the courtyard headed your way . 
( SIGHS ) Have you read Marley and Me ? 
You always had tunnel vision . 
I 've never seen a weapons system like this . 
Turn ... your phone off . 
I got to take this . 
I 'll be impressed if he just talks to a girl tonight . 
I did . 
I was just a kid . 
But be patient , Anakin . 
Your rebellion is over . 
What are you doing here ? 
I 've never seen a copycat with this level of precision before . 
Farragut 's death seems like an open-and-shut drunk driving fatality . 
And then , I don 't know , 
Humor me , please . 
Tired . 
Heck no . 
You said he was a good man . 
It 's beautiful . 
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt . 
Are there stairs near you ? 
Let 's have a little look . 
But right now , Julian is a scared kid . 
Isabelle , come on ! 
Where 's Dad ? 
A tiger . 
That 's great . 
- Okay , Lily , you got the bread ? 
This bitch shot Craze . 
No , this is ridiculous . 
Hi sister , how are you ? 
Thank you . 
You couldn 't help anyone . 
They 've been here for years . 
Okay , let me show you why you guys are here . 
- l don 't want to see you here again . 
Not that I bought it . 
We 're talking about a billion dollar weapons project . 
How does he do that ? 
Scrub hard . 
It 's like an all-access pass for proving their gang affiliation . 
Oh , it 's just dinner . 
So what if it 's stillborn ? 
Of all the harlots he had ever made ... 
We got a possible resurrection going on over here . 
I 'm sorry . 
Anakin , wait Wait 
You like this song ? 
- Wait there . 
We anticipated it , as you people are such clichés . 
Trust me . 
Oh , you 're a purist , huh ? 
Can you hold out for another hour ? 
This is just a minor setback for me . 
And you don 't worry about spoiling him ? 
What 's it do ? 
Much of it will have to be imagined . 
He " s a big boy . 
Check out the address ! 
His father doesn 't participate in the gatherings . 
- We need to slow down ! 
It 's moving fast . 
House sweeps ? 
Go away , Anna . 
Could we change this up for $ 1,000 chips , please ? 
That Mario Pepper guy was a patsy , huh ? 
You 're alright . 
Sword ! 
To keep my family together . 
Dad , I 'm so sorry . 
But the process falters .

The Ramón stamp . 
Every formation has its weakness

The great birds have arrived . 
Just one . 
We just came from the gym . 
I know she 's out there ... 
What you experienced , Wesley , was not a panic attack . 
What 's the matter ? 
There 's so much I don 't understand .

She seems nice . 
I said get up ! 
No , there must be some mistake . 
I understand you have an Indian problem . 
One in Freiburg , one in New York and One in Rome . 
It was pretty impulsive , even for me . 
Let us go .

Somehow I doubt that . 
Goddamned bugs . 
Watch me . 
You lost a nuke in Moscow ? 
Do you drink ? 
Let 's go home . 
They 're all exploding inside my brain , all this knowledge . 
Looks like he 's going to be staying with us for a while . 
I will see you at the office ! 
- How big ? 
It 's not your fault kid . 
Want to try some ? 
Formics might have wiped us out the last time , you know . 
I 'm sorry , son . 
My , you do remember a lot , don 't you ? 
Because it if doesn 't , you 'll be hearing from me . 
Ah , hey . 
They make jokes . 
I must compliment you on the Gold Cloaks ' performance these last few weeks . 
I can only imagine how scary it must be living in fear of sudden death . 
Those scars on your head . 
That is a uniquely prudish way of putting it . 
Ah , genius . 
Just ... checking on you . 
After you went all that way ? 
Look , I know everyone saw something different . 
Know this place . 
I 'm not sure , somewhere in eastern New York , I think . 
What are we , in grade school ? 
I always get in trouble for this kind of stuff . 
Get up . 
Get rid of it . 
Sir , might I suggest that you ... 
Always trying to figure out where they fit in . 
Chuck , what 's going on ? 
Wherever . 
I 'm guessing that you 're not just in the neighborhood . 
But what if they didn 't sound like a bunch of jerk offs ? 
No , just talking to you helps . 
Shall we ? 
Care to guess what that company is worth now ? 
I didn 't think you 'd be gone so long . 
Then she dumped the gun in the lake on the way home . 
And just know that while you are all sitting in jail , 
My work here is protected , even from you . 
- Let me take a look . 
I 'll be fine . 
No , Patrick .

What if people weren 't exposed at home ? 
We 've spoken of this . 
He liked to hit my mother . 
Thank you . 
Wake up .

I thought I 'd toughen him up . 
We 'll just ask the kid how he did it . 
That 's all ? 
WillJigo be satisfied with the creature 's head ... or will he be after my ironworks as well ? 
I expect you to offer up a solution . 
That 's why you 're acting so damn cagey . 
A medical facility of your own with unlimited resources .

Leave us alone . 
This afternoon , Monsieur Gustave ? 
You 're not much of a talker , are you ? 
I can put myself in your shoes . 
I 'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day , trying to find advertisers ! 
So how long have you known Carrie ? 
You met her down the pub . 
What a king he was . 
I feel dizzy . 
It 's papa . 
Real burn there , Alec . 
Tobias Ford . 
That 's why I helped him out . 
Stupid , right ? 
- The creek should be right over ... 
I recognized the address as soon as it came up . 
You have a problem . 
Do what he says , Marcus . 
Saul , could I speak with you ? 
- You can ? 
Very interested . 
What 's going on ? 
16 years . 
How far did you carry me ? 
He 's clueless , as usual . 
You are gonna give us another . 
That 's very nice , but I should go . 
Absolutely not . 
Knows all about where the crows are and what they 're planning . 
He and Monsieur De Soto have already spoken . 
Isn 't that right , Adam ? 
Yeah , no , I guess it did , kind of . 
Follow me 
I think I like you . 
I already have my doctorate . 
The numbers don 't add up , caitlin . 
Samaritan operatives . 
Otherwise , you 're not my top sports writer , eh ? 
It 's open ! 
There is no pageant to perform , okay , and your disappointment is irrelevant . 
Danny asked her to go home with him , and she said no . 
The alcoholism . 
How about my son back ? 
Positive pressure . 
Oh , this can 't be happening . 
What have you done ? 
I said , I know and admire your wonderful work . 
We wrote the term life policies for Grant Whitaker . 
And who handed him the keys ? 
Two lovely daughters . 
Means they can add a pound to the fees . 
- Wet your lip . 
You 're telling me not to commit professional suicide ? 
Drop your weapon ! 
What the fuck ? 
Tsugumo-sama . 
Lorelei shot him . 
Fucking awesome ! 
The saints are marching in ! 
Happy ending , right ? 
In extreme cases like this one , electroconvulsive therapy . 
I mean , I think it 's too young for me , but I think you have excellent taste . 
Sergeant Brody , I meant it . 
Helping you . 
I 'm sorry I 've wasted your time . 
Arya Stark , come with us . 
Yes , make it , Chris . 
You 've got to stop worrying about me . 
Teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman . 
Put your hands behind your head . 
- They 're over-rated . 
And thanks for sorting him out this morning . 
Jai , this is no time to fool around . 
( James ) So many perfect days . 
Yeah , I know what it is Gollum . 
He 's being questioned by the united states senate . 
To make him say yes ! 
I have commanded law enforcement agencies , emergency services and first responders to keep their deployment level ... 
If anything happens to him ... 
I think I can see how that might put some attitude into their attitudes . 
- No , I 'm just an analyst . 
So , Juliet , what do you think of ben ? 
There it is , come on Bigfoot let 's go .

Hello , John . 
I couldn 't take any more .

They are the strongest and the fastest of us all . 
It doesn 't make any sense . 
Hide that , hide your weapons in your clothes . 
Did you find anything in the trunk of this one ? 
Lately , I haven 't looked at it as much as I should have . 
All civilians . 
Miss Hewes , your limo 's waiting . 
Did you find anything ? 
Do any of you understand how a man can hurt inside ? 
One agent reaching out . 
It 's not as though our lives depend on it or anything . 
Can we talk inside ? 
Uzbekistan 's army , how big is it ? 
- That 's a slave ship . 
If cromartie 's damaged , he 's vulnerable .

Look at that . 
You know what else they didn 't tell me ? 
And he loved you back . 
Because of what she did to my family . 
Quickly ! 
You still don 't think he did it ? 
For zeta ! 
Quite a safe collection your husband had . 
Anything ? 
I 'm in it for the money . 
Got us a German here who wants to die for country . 
- That 's enough airman ! 
Are you confused or something ? 
Technically , he 's an ass . 
Maybe that 's ' cause you weren 't actually slinging as much bullshit as you thought . 
Oh , no . 
Certain details of the victim 's statement caught our eye . 
If someone 's waiting for a lie , you can 't just , er , give them one . 
Yes . 
This is my standing . 
This is where Juliet brought me . 
Keep sending me those letters . 
I consider it a privilege to perform last rites . 
Okay , can you flex your knee for me ? 
Could I have their names and addresses , please ? 
Now why would I know that ? 
Uh , no , they 're my sidekicks . 
- No . 
He brought them to his village to be healed . 
Barry , in your heart of hearts , do you think it 's possible .

- What the fuck happened to him ? 
That 's the one . 
You 're under arrest . 
I know it will . 
I didn 't need it to prove my point , of course , but it helped . 
Keep pulling . 
I don 't know how to sell " okay . " 
You keep the change on that . 
So you and Greg are coworkers ? 
Some bugger up in the mountains must have siphoned it off . 
It 's completely exposed you . 
We 'll figure that out at the station . 
- I would like that . 
That 's from someone named Bella , and you got it last December . 
- Quinn ? 
Would you like to talk about it ? 
A hello would be nice . 
I don 't even want to know . 
Search everywhere ! 
Elm Street 's last brat . 
One of them must have put it there .

He could never get it to work . 
- Stay down . 
Anders , back a bit .

Near the waterhole .

He didn 't know . 
Okay , but I 'm not so good with fashion . 
- The baby is fine ! 
You should buy a cabin , John . 
- What 'd he say ? 
Can I just pee in a cup ? 
If Jon was here , why would they put his wolf in a cage ? 
And I got a picture of him . 
What is this ? 
- Thanks . 
It 's really not necessary . 
You got eyes on him ? 
We 're well aware of our chances . 
You 're sick . 
It 's me . 
I 'm going to see a man about a wallaby . 
Here , darling . 
Get us lower . 
Doctor , if you have any other ideas , I am all ears . 
What do you mean ? 
The pass is revoked . 
Doctor , thank you for coming . 
John , don 't say a word . 
The imam ? 
I like to finish breakfast by 8 : 30 in the morning . 
If my brother 's in there , get him out alive . 
How 's it different ? 
Mikhail dropped it off . 
I don 't know how to get it to go back . 
- How you feeling ? 
It 's too early to say . 
- Somebody will find us . 
You wouldn 't do that to me , would you ? 
That 's a nice bluff . 
Apparently , that was a lie ! 
I ran into someone this morning . 
What 's your name there , sir ? 
Yes , sir . 
Why ? 
" Here ! 
Hey buddy , cars don 't fly . 
Okay , now we 're even .

It 's not good . 
I just want to get Nazir . 
You 're stayin ' with me down on University , right ?

Things that might even be hard to accept . 
We were right here . 
We gotta see her . 
Just hurry

Where were you last night ? 
I would really like to meet Lisa sometime , besides a brief encounter in her underwear . 
- DA 's dropping the charges . 
Hum ... the library .

Giant ancient drawings carved into the desert floor in Peru . 
I never lie ! 
No country for white men , boy . 
You mean your friends in the Mob ? 
Great , good luck with that . 
All we have is one witness outside of the crime scene , that 's it . 
It was me . 
Go on . 
- Your phone was off . 
I don 't know , like an alley . 
How did that thing with that guy go ? 
And Merry Christmas .

He clean . 
And we get past all this . 
Help me ! 
Baseball cap , give it up . 
- Paul , what do you need ? 
You got distracted by sand on a beach . 
Get back ! 
Where are you going ? 
And so , I distanced myself from other people in my life . 
Blast them . 
- I wasn 't looking at it . 
Maybe you 're just in my way . 
What about the virus , Ellie ? 
That 's what I was getting . 
Don 't scan my testicles ever again . 
Maybe just a little bit . 
We 're about to heat this up . 
Who wants to see if Tarzan died in his sleep last night ? 
As long as we have Scylla , we have power .

I supposed I should apologize , too .

Why is that ? 
And what were you doing on the Great East Road ?

Now it 's time for the real fireworks . 
Brave kids . 
Victim 's name is Julia Howard . 
Show yourself some respect . 
I got him from here , guys . 
I handpicked this group . 
Because it will be our fault if we turn this thing on and blow a hole in Central City .

I figured I 'd start with you .

It 's unorthodox , but not unheard of .

Interesting . 
You shall loathe . 
We don 't say that in this house . 
- Time enough for that later- - 
What is it ? 
I never stopped . 
Just start at the very top . 
Don 't move . 
Then do it . 
The first time we met ... 
Why did your father tell you this now ? 
We can never come back to this car .

They 're retreating . 
He took her from her mother 's house without asking . 
It 'll play great for a jury . 
Yeah , that 's right . 
I-I have just one question for the both of you . 
Your father once told me he didn 't believe in guns . 
I saw the pictures at your house . 
But that 's always been your problem , Gary . 
Well , then , we fight them . 
I must admit I do not . 
What i 'm saying , gentlemen , 
Anyone with boobs can get a frat boy to do anything . 
You 're not gonna have time to shave . 
You use them when you tell the story . 
I 'll make sure he gets what he needs , and they can reimburse me later . 
Good bye ! 
So didn 't you want to have a chat with Dominic ? 
Oh , it 's all right , Rigsby .

But ... don 't take my word for it . 
You 'd like my room . 
Then what ?

Please , please , I just need to speak to him . 
Just give me the word , I 'll splatter him . 
- Aww , you 'll catch up .

These men are here to kill us . 
Uh , it was a nosebleed . 
We made it as far as Caldwell before we ran out of money .

Laura , reading :

I don 't like being so far in Zero 's territory . 
You got those matches on you mate ? 
And then there 's the disloyal . 
My son 
So from that moment on ,

Check out places that he might have gone looking for work . 
My boy 's nine .

I 'm a dance major ! 
You know , one of my manservants holds the hair dryer but I work the comb , okay ?

The other night , I meet a girl . 
Well , now , that is simply not the case . 
Very . 
Thank you ? 
I believe we can help each other .

Like I said , we 're from out of town . 
Is that the right date ? 
I don 't have to tell you that . 
I have three different Federal agencies looking to indict me . 
That 's two military guys . 
An atheist ? 
You taped together your whole theory with a couple of random conversations I 've had with a drug dealer . 
I can 't help you there . 
She 's really playing hardball . 
How strong is your stomach ?

- It has to come from her . 
Because I asked her . 
You move your lips and your father 's voice comes out . 
Tanners practically a fish himself . 
- She has a way of putting things . 
Keep humanity 's free will intact . 
Those are Erik 's words , not yours .

It 's a start . 
You mind if I step out and get some air ? 
You 're cleaning up the drones from the war ? 
My boss at the turnip plant won them over with his charm . 
You remember what I told you to do when there 's danger ? 
Ellie ! 
I heard the voices . 
He 's fast and she 's weird . 
Adjust course to 0.6 degrees south .

Any idea who might have taken it ? 
Where is her coat ? 
What 's he saying ? 
I suppose .

Good for you . 
How come she didn 't get in trouble ? 
Baum is just a name .

Mmm . 
You used to have a little mettle in you , kid . 
What necklace ? 
This is given name of The Butcher . 
No , you need to put your enemy in the ground . 
Which means we just jumped to the top of the wanted list . 
Yeah , I don 't care . 
Tommy is a good person . 
That doesn 't mean he didn 't do it . 
I know . 
Then who is the suspect ? 
- Dr. Francis Dulmacher . 
Which is why I have an insurance policy in place . 
You forgot to ask if I 'm a liar . 
Yellow cab driver , get out of your vehicle ! 
Peter versus tris .

Vary from these instructions and I 'll kill you , understand ? 
It 's probably why birthdays are so meaningful to you . 
You have some kind of beef with him or something ? 
We 're merely a couple of concerned dog owners ,

Did you have bad dreams again ? 
Clients ? 
Are you bored of me ?

I 've missed you . 
I found something as well . 
And they want in on Scylla . 
And if one of us is lost , we find them , and if one of us is in trouble , we help them .

That 's new . 
Sold it to a client . 
Same as you ... car trouble . 
Ugh , they used a sharpie .

Apologize , but it 's true . 
It approaches , doesn 't it ? 
I promise . 
Dreaming . 
Yes , you were . 
Lyla , that 's not why I called . 
You didn 't answer my question before . 
No , I 'm sure it 's not . 
Because if I don 't , we 've lost . 
I don 't know .

How is that even possible ? 
We have to finish rebuilding the city .

Does she know the truth about you ? 
And then Chaz comes in with the shotgun . 
I 'll come back . 
- Yeah , well , it 's occupied . 
How do you know ? 
I could explain it to her . 
More for the people-watching than the music .

I 've talked to women before . 
I 'm the one who dragged him all into this . 
He fought at Shiloh . 
They 're just creating a perimeter . 
As thick ' n white as New England snow . 
And there goes Theodore .

You did not feel it in here . 
I 'm sorry ? 
He was being followed , you know ? 
Rowan ? 
All right . 
A girl like this will keep you running in circles . 
Peter , we need to talk about ...

I 'm not seeing her until Saturday night . 
Where 's your boyfriend on your birthday ? 
You knew you were dead . 
They pushed me down , and Stan pointed his gun at me . 
What 's happening ? 
I 'll order an echo , just to be safe . 
I wasn 't supposed to , but ... 
Get off me ! 
She 's here .

And if your answer is again no ... 
You and her . 
This is about trust , Ryan . 
Do you have it on ? 
Hercules ' fists have been dipped in the blood of the hydra !

Traffic lights . 
John , stop .

One thing , and then promise me you 'll go home . 
This achieves nothing . 
- What 's the date ? 
It 's the last thing you need to hear right now . 
I could 've at least been looking for a place for you ! 
Ignore all of that . 
I may not be able to save it . 
And tell her I love her . 
When you 've dropped your second gun . 
- What would it be ?

You settling in okay ? 
I 've actually got the real thing waiting for me in the other room .

Tell me this will make a difference . 
Male " life check , all green " he 's good . 
About what ? 
I can see why the police called off the search . 
You sure ? 
I wish someone would send me off to the Caymans .

You read a great deal of fiction , don 't you ? 
Please remain calm . 
That 's why he went up on the ship , to save me . 
She called up here for you not too long ago . 
The last time I spoke to her , she was in that location - Columbus Circle , 2015 . 
We were never the problem . 
I would never do anything to hurt her . 
Can you tell us what that means ? 
It 's not far .

Fuck you , Vazquez ! 
They 're all over the car . 
It was just a joke . 
It 's a penal colony on the shores of Australia . 
There 's something that I have to tell you .

You got kids ? 
Stop bitching , You got a Super Soaker still . 
" I don 't know how l ever latched on to someone like you , 
They wouldn 't know what to do with all this .

Just give me a minute , hmm ? 
As you know , Will is a big fly fisherman and he designs all of his own lures . 
- There 's no point of impact . 
I thought we could have a drink down by the water . 
You 're doing your thing . 
So the sniper was inside ? 
How would cruelly killing your daughter in front of you in any way help the situation ? 
- You gotta be kidding me , right ? 
The bureau is compromised . 
- Hi , baby . 
Great . 
And now I 'll tell you where our little sweetie is this minute ! 
You sold us out ! 
- Because the flash is coming . 
What the hell is going on ? 
Why not ? 
Sorry to disappoint you .

You ? 
Broke my neck . 
See you . 
We 're OK .

What kind of church is this ? 
Rick , this is my husband Reg . 
And with that , he hurls himself forward ! 
He 's out of bounds for you , Helen , way out of bounds . 
He 's the talent . 
Are you okay ? 
It was snowing ... 
Your prince . 
So that means I can 't get involved . 
Who 're you looking at ? 
We were semi-Nomadic , of course , 
How you feeling , Ken ? 
- I 'm quite sure . 
Did you hear me ? 
It 'll be resolved by then , one way or the other .

Release all remaining countermeasures . 
It was of the future . 
But there 's nothing wrong with the faces . 
Or is it classified between you and Queeg ? 
I 'll give you the shot if you tell me where the gang 's holed up . 
Okay , well , could you look into 
Actually , yes , I just did , I 'm going to have to get off the phone . 
How are you always finding this stuff ? 
We need to talk . 
Deal . 
Nice landing . 
Right , yeah . 
But now on to a more serious subject . 
You shouldn 't have gone to all this trouble just for me . 
- Ready , Simon ? 
He was my best customer . 
You 're making a mistake . 
Your move . 
... and , action ! 
Um , I will get lost if you say yes . 
Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller . 
Do you want me to stop and get it out ?

Initiating neural handshake . 
Spyros , the train !

She has a broken wrist and a concussion . 
I need to speak to the C.O. immediately . 
Let 's go . 
Would the finalists please move to the competition area ? 
Late at night .

All by myself . 
Oh , Susan , what did you do ? 
I 'm sorry , My Princess .

Along for the ride , baby ! 
- Thanks to her , no doubt . 
I 'm sorry . 
You don 't care if a sister gets into trouble and loses her position . 
Just kidding . 
You ain 't had to add the " good riddance " part . 
I wasn 't lying . 
Whatever . 
So one has . 
Try to think of the good times . 
And what 's happening is originating from there- - 
Father Travis said he brought you here for your own good .

- No , don 't throw him / her of the language . 
Well done . 
- We gotta find out . 
We don 't know . 
That 's my girl . 
It 'll be like you 're leaving us all over again . 
Let 's tango . 
Although , one of them did ask me for my number . 
Your mother needs this money . 
Just relax . 
I 'm sure many things are racing through your mind right now . 
I thought Saul and Estes already wrangled Faber . 
All right , Glen . 
No , and he wasn 't flying anywhere . 
Like Jesse . 
- I was just getting comfortable . 
Go now , while you have the light . 
Go ! 
So , um , how long does he have to stay ? 
Just don 't go anywhere . 
- Tommy , we 're fine . 
Then she started to talk to Steve about his mother . 
- Take care . 
So , how am I doing ? 
No , no , they don 't suspect him . 
That 's not true , that 's not true . 
No disrespect intended , sir , but shove it up your ass .

He 's a politician . 
Asked for more money . 
One damn time . 
Lieutenant , you were given specific orders . 
I haven 't seen or heard from my daughter for three years . 
There 's nothing out here . 
He 's inches away from the pit wall ! 
When was the last time you were here ? 
Well , I 'm no stranger to obsessive personalities , but this seems ... 
You two go upstairs and play . 
I 'm worried about the ramifications . 
I 've been gone all night . 
He just wants to keep you safe . 
I know this . 
From the shooting , no . 
Hey , boss . 
You 're dead on your feet . 
What did you dream ? 
Even when they don 't fit at all .

So you made arrangements for your wife 's care . 
Is it proper for a young prince to expect the King to wait for him ? 
Nothing happened between you and me . 
It would 've dropped equally as fast . 
Of course . 
We have to balance it out ! 
- This is dispatch . 
You copy it . 
Come on ! 
Where do you need to go ? 
I get the feeling you miss Phlox , too . 
Senior boys are the only way to go . 
Sandy Bachman would be alive today . 
But I know who would know .

Are you afraid to die ? 
The animal 's already dead . 
Debra , I 've known you since the day you were born . 
I didn 't know what you were like . 
Can you see how many people are in the car ? 
But you gotta tell me somethin ' . 
The strings were being drawn tighter and tighter . 
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly . 
They 're already dead . 
You 're forgetting one thing , Watson . 
But without my help , you will never find your precious satchel . 
Will you do that for me , honey ? 
We 've got some common ground . 
You got about 20 of those pending against you . 
I 'm all set .

What are you talking about ? 
So , where 's he at ? 
Come on and help me ! 
You 've never used them before . 
She watches so much news ...

Simmer down , Homer . 
This machine ?

Actually , no . 
Astrid , come quickly . 
To who ? 
Can 't wait to hear that . 
I see . 
The boat phone ? 
Shooter on the right ! 
Your daughter 's watching you .

What do we do ? 
There 's no denying that .

Not human . 
So will the people you love .

Which explains where my cell phone went . 
Presumably , you 'll need more time .

There are things in his life that happened . 
Where 's the car ? 
What , of the wall ? 
She lived in the same neighborhood as the bennetts . 
And it 's still quivering there today . 
Please , send me . 
There 's that fag talk we talked about . 
- Mm , yes . 
That 's them sons-a-bitches . 
I agree . 
We have the knowledge of what will happen and the power to imagine better . 
What 's that ? 
What 's up , Cap ? 
They could be here any minute . 
Why do you have an eagle on your head ? 
Gas the bitch ! 
Oh , but you are . 
But my findings are still rudimentary .

She fooled us all , mate . 
And I will consider that apology .

You want me to protect his parents ? 
To offer you something no one else can . 
Count to a hundred . 
She likes it better when I figure it out myself . 
Everybody went to the other bank . 
Perhaps we should call , when we are next in town . 
Where are you , huh ? 
Me ? 
You 've been wonderfully helpful . 
Mr. Freling . 
Hard not to . 
Hopefully , they will have more success than our last . 
Which would explain why they 're here . 
That 's obviously you , fellas . 
Why are you doing this right now ? 
Millie , I am sorry . 
I don 't have that much of an appetite . 
You 're going to get yourself arrested .

I say we fight .

I never gave them to him . 
Pretty good . 
You 're not going to send Paddington to the authorities , are you ? 
Your thoughts betray you , Viceroy 
You had to look out for yourself , huh ?

Krumitz , you 're sure this is Lomis ? 
I don 't care . 
We have to think of them first .

Looks like the package . 
That 's worst-case scenario . 
If he didn 't show up tonight , he 's not coming back .

Would that I were . 
And all of the packing boxes . 
Ever since you learned my name .

You didn 't wear that shirt to school ? 
Tell me .

Well it wouldn 't have been 
Only an amateur would carry that liquid dynamite in the car . 
I don 't know what you 're talking about . 
Give me the Demerol .

But as a starting point , maybe . 
When you gave me this ... 
- How 's that signal ? 
Well , you look like something the cat dragged in .

Arthur frobisher- - he wiped out our whole retirement account . 
He loves his wife . 
Ooh , that 's probably not it . 
He can 't . 
So you had Walker on the payroll too , 
Please . 
Get the knife . 
When did you decide to turn your back on me ? 
We 'll take them with us . 
Some of this tech is similar to yours , but these other components , I have no idea what they are . 
Is he leaving me ? 
Over off the interstate . 
Will is my friend . 
My uncle Gerald 's been struck by lightning three times . 
Making sοme changes tο the garden , I see . 
What the fuck is this ? 
I mean one time we wrecked an entire suite at the hotel Drake . 
She had them locked up in a room . 
- Dre , you 're ready ? 
Now , this ... 
I don 't know . 
- Let 's discuss it . 
So we 're clear ?

You may want to back off a little bit . 
I swear , m 'lord , I don 't know . 
Baby ... 
No , we just need to leave . 
- Just kidding . 
Do you think this is a joke ? 
Or should I call you " Mr. Flood " ? 
Your guess is as good as mine . 
I actually have to go . 
[ Chuckles ] Copy that . 
Shut up . 
And I just want to let you know that , no matter what happens I 'm really grateful to you . 
I think you should hang in there , all right ? 
Makin ' everyone else do your dirty work , Mandi ? 
Buddy , nobody 's getting to Hank . 
Do you speak English ? 
Then he made his own cards . 
Now , who exactly are these guys ? 
Was it because of my baby ? 
Really ? 
What 's that ? 
- Yοu knοw , 
But now I 'm standing here ... 
Oh , I heard Melissa and Todd had a really fun time today . 
Sherlock Holmes ! 
And I hope you never have to . 
Jones is trying to collapse both universes . 
Drugs , guns , money , women . 
Your account 's been frozen . 
- how old they are ? 
Check it out . 
Maybe you could put him to sleep for me ? 
Now you 're telling me that I 'm their enemy . 
Well , it 's $ 5 million . 
Not for the killing , of course . 
Roderick ? 
Are you Native American , Tito ? 
- Dr. Vaughn released her to the mortuary . 
I gave her six years . 
I 'm so sorry . 
Why not just throw them in an incinerator ? 
- Yes , l did . 
Then whom can we trust ? 
Are you crying ? 
Also she could be remarkably charming . 
So why are we here ? 
Hey , Josh , I 'm a thief . 
Maybe one in a million . 
Smells like half-bloods ! 
- It 's for you , man . 
We need to end it . 
- To save him from Leif 's misguided experiments . 
Right this way , gentlemen . 
Every village or sheltered place will be deserted . 
I agree with the crocodile . 
- You really liked them ? 
This is Brennan . 
Do you really think , after this is over , you can all just disappear ? 
To find my science officer . 
- Yes , they are . 
Master Bruce ? 
- On the king 's mission ? 
Perhaps it is jabassa 's child . 
Red Dog was shot ? 
Or you can just show me how to do it so , I can get out of your hair . 
Toki , come here . 
But Amadeu skipped two grades ; 
We have to leave this truck here for a while . 
Why the hell didn 't it ? 
Why do you laugh ? 
She didn 't even know it was coming . 
- You 're sure ? 
Seems like they 're changing strategies . 
All right , be careful now . 
Where have you been ? 
Battalion , halt ! 
That guy 's the paramedic that saved your life . 
Joe , um ... 
Bled out , fell to this position . 
You 're the little guy in the front row . 
- Who 's speaking , please ? 
You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost ? 
Signal established . 
And , for the first time in my life , I didn 't know what to say . 
Might we take a look in your backyard ? 
Look at his jacket . 
I mean , it just ... 
She is my mother , and Jacob is your nephew , okay ? 
- What ? 
Even after all the choices keep getting taken away . 
I don 't know how you saw it , but you did . 
On the ice , you said ... " him . " 
Find me Agent Wheeler . 
I thought it suspicious . 
You better eat every bite of that . 
You 're not gonna lose me . 
I guess you can 't be all that bad , Mr. Zombie . 
You had no idea your king lived seven blocks from this consulate all these years ? 
A sniper won 't aim for your head . 
I understand . 
Did you hear about Runflat ? 
Look there at that woman . 
Have a nice flight . 
Riedel . 
He saw some , uh , suspicious activity . 
Get a fix on my location . 
Smart enough to know that this is your reality and not mine . 
Both . 
Did she know that you liked her ? 
- I 'm fine , just get me the hell out of here . 
Is this before the war , Mrs. Croft , when you were a factory worker ? 
All right , we 'll knock ' em back . 
4,642 students from 27 countries . 
Mrs. Altmann , your aunt is around this corner . 
If I win ... 
You don 't get out to the island very often . 
Adopted sister . 
We 're having a bad enough day . 
All I 'm asking is that you give me a little bit of your time in return . 
It 's Ice Age , Mom . 
You are breaking out of this prison , Mr. Scofield . 
You sure ? 
- He was strung up with fish hooks . 
The wise woman wants everybody back to the village at once . 
Or just hold an apple in my hand . 
Pink stars . 
Since you stopped the soldier that was sent after val , 
Your honor , this is nothing but hearsay . 
How 's Dad doing ? 
Police headquarters , 7th arrondissement ? 
What 's wrong with a tracksuit ? 
Like , what 's the alarm code ? 
Kilo Two , OK , over . 
I 'm guessing it 's our best shot at finding Grace . 
But what does it mean to us ? 
Come to my room . 
Where are you from ? 
That 's right . 
When you didn 't show , they sent me to check to see if you 'd died or something . 
The families have concerns . 
We 're also very concerned about Kitayama-san 's case . 
Well , I don 't know , but ... 
Sounds like a plan to me . 
This one time , I coughed up an entire Dalmatian . 
Not picking them off one by one from the shadows anymore . 
My boy . 
I 'm able to protect those around me . 
Just like that I made two grand . 
It 's Rob Cole . 
Didn 't want to miss anything . 
The crew is united behind me . 
Hommi , Do good ? 
Ivan ? 
Good night . 
Sir , may I remind you that you 've been awake for nearly 72 hours . 
Stop it ! 
Then I told him / her : 
I could have taken them on a cruise . 
Kermit signed 30 years ago , that contains ... 
- Get her ! 
Target their propulsion systems . 
That 's a little pessimistic . 
If she wasn 't prepping for a case , she was photo-sharing . 
AND I WANT IT TO BE SLOW . 
You wrote this ? 
I 've never seen you leave during a case before . 
- Bloody empty . 
That you should be the new lieutenant , not me . 
Back burns . 
I 'm forwarding Dig your ping along with the foundation schematics . 
And jalapeÃ ± os . 
Me . 
This is a family museum , sir . 
I 'm not gonna help usher your enemies out of town . 
Ryan Burnett is dead . 
Please don 't call me that . 
AMERIGO : 
I know it did . 
What were his exact words , please ? 
Don 't ! 
Oh , God , Susan . 
You startled me , Greer . 
To support you ? 
That was a sucker move , burning down your boss . 
Kill him now . 
Especially beer . 
Wait a minute ... 
We 're not gonna . 
Mine ... 
Uncle Kevan , maybe . 
I just want you to be happy , man . 
Yeah , I 'm kind of hooked on machines . 
- let 's start with ... how 'd you get involved in this ? 
[ I didn 't have a destination , ] 
Well , there was that one time in college ... 
Tell em 
Tall mocha macchiato , right ? 
( BELLOWING ) 
- There were no other options . 
S 
It says Walker was a lone sniper . 
I 'm Rosalee . 
My vow never to kill . 
Yeah , I still can 't believe he 's an ex-mob enforcer . 
Sir , sir , is that true ? 
Not that I 'm tired or anything from a lack of caffeine , mind you , ' cause I 'm not . 
You must tend the Engine ... 
Now , if you could drive me to my residence . 
Doc Dugan is dead . 
It was good . 
- That 's why I asked for you . 
Why don 't you do them to Tom instead ? 
That son of a bitch . 
And what kind of kid follows a kid who does this ? 
Very true . 
Are we good ? 
You got away with $ 74,802 . 
How about Slugline ? 
You 're certain ? 
And if you up and cross that line , it just might cost you your life . 
Never lost one yet . 
And my parents have treated the gaming as the cause of it . 
Science ... the most potent distraction of all . 
She was ready to call the county on ' em . 
I think it 's very good . 
We didn 't get much off Jeremy 's phone . 
- lt 's not that easy . 
Turn it off . 
I feel so fucked up . 
Machete happens . 
I swear , all I heard was static . 
Of course you can . 
What happened ? 
You deprived me of my childhood . 
It is in this business . 
Excuse me , but I 'm expecting my husband any minute . 
But you have to do something for me first . 
Seven seconds . 
We certainly hope you all enjoy the show . 
What happens if Grodd takes over your mind the same way he did with Eiling ? 
Who 's that ? 
Apá , no ! 
You know something . 
You think we have a murder victim here ? 
Yeah , that 's the plan . 
Uh , just came by to get your read on these pants . 
Please help ! 
There you go . 
I just want you to let me know what he 's up to , how he works . 
It 's a delivery schedule . 
I did what I could . 
I can 't believe you just turned down a science project . 
But we do it my way . 
They come with a price . 
You tie someone to a stone , get a fancy dagger and a bunch of robes . 
They 're fucking horrible , Fergus . 
There was , there was a light . 
She doesn 't seem like the magic stealing type . 
There 's metal everywhere these days . 
Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell . 
Well ... 
Snausages ? 
Pretty much everything he could think of . 
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there . 
You don 't have to be a bad-ass to be a superhero , Dave . 
Now that you 're home , is your first plan to kill Niklaus ? 
I was a bit of fun , that 's all . 
- Continue ... 
- Ofelia ! 
Jack , please . 
He ruined your life . 
I am a man of reason . 
Elevator 's not working . 
Afraid this cowboy 's been to his last hoedown . 
You up for a little nostalgia ? 
- Hey , look at me . 
And we 'll wait the Haka of New Zealand . 
What 's the matter ? 
Or do you want to live ? 
How did you find your way to Earth ? 
So , what 's going on ? 
Because I 'm being interrogated by the police . 
Sir ... 
That 's how I know Moose is your client . 
None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal . 
This dog will love me , and I will love him . 
Yeah , you know , like tears of joy , that kind of thing . 
Do you also handle the results ? 
I don 't know what I 'm gonna get from a tox screen . 
She wasn 't in the office . 
all the way down . 
Actually , it 's Dent . 
An old friend , like Master Kenobi . 
Mrs. Hudson took my skull . 
You get to Gethers and that 's how you get to fuckin ' Hagan . 
- -I got fifty . 
Just call me . 
I mean , heh , I like feet , but this is just cray-cray . 
I talked with Connor about safety all the time . 
I have no clue either , so you 'll have to ask him . 
Who are they ? 
Can I keep the goddamn land , Marshall ? 
Who 's Cameron expecting ? 
I knew it was one of mine , and I said to myself , " Jimmy boy , 
Rich couple gets divorced , they need four houses instead of two . 
Yeah , he wanted out of prison , too . 
It 's been a while . 
My sweet boy . 
That is why the extremists hate him . 
Your coach had had you pegged as Olympic team material . 
So I 'm roughly the size of a barge 
Mostly in the west dormitory . 
- We 're going out for a meal tonight . 
Bit of a letdown , actually . 
I just lost two testers , I have a right to be . 
But they 'd already spotted us , and they had something high-velocity ... 
We didn 't know it , because we weren 't doing it . 
I hear you . 
Accept his friendship . 
You 're interfering with me ! 
We will extend every courtesy to you . 
Perhaps just a peek . 
Flynn will be home soon . 
I need you to see something . 
I 'd be proud to call you my son . 
I do understand . 
James , they can 't get in here , right ? 
Might be why Pete Harris beat it to Mexico . 
Frosted 's good . 
So if he mentions anything about a savings account , just play along , okay ? 
Tell them to bring the M-VAC system . 
A brilliant commander is the only thing that saved us . 
What have I done ? 
No , we were compromised , damn it . 
There 's forgiveness . 
What 's with this camera ? 
And can you think of any reason that someone might have wanted to harm your husband ? 
It 's a public shaming . 
Bitch looked like a weapon with a weapon . 
No offense , Thea , but your brother 's kind of a wimp . 
- No . 
Don 't leave me , Anya ! 
- For the week . 
Find out ... 
More water . 
First time we come in , there will always be a little bit of tension happening between us and them . 
Only one guard , but he doesn 't really seem that capable 
There 's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact . 
But how 's your footwork ? 
That 's not an answer . 
You saved my life . 
- Yeah . 
- Shut up ! 
- Come on . 
How can I know what you know ? 
Can I talk to you please ? 
I know that . 
Ten more approaching from the back . 
That 's right . 
Lot more trouble , though . 
First or last ? 
Have you erased it ? 
And that 's what you 're going to do . 
- You find that funny ? 
He 's ... 
There 's a secret to it . 
There 's an American Navy man here . 
What 'll we do when that brat gets here ? 
- Oh , God . 
Leave us . 
I 'm not gonna hurt you . 
Dad . 
- Don 't smoke . 
- And plus he lied about sleeping with the victim . 
I gave him you . 
We 've hit the mother lode . 
What does it say ? 
And we need you to open up the gates . 
What the hell ? 
It 's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement . 
Turned left , probably to see Artur . 
Let 's look at his life on the inside . 
- Does that matter ? 
Maybe because ... 
Mike Anderson . 
Are you sure you know where you 're going ? 
" ' It 's windy , ' he said . 
Something 's wrong . 
I think I 'm gonna go to sleep . 
" Built up " implies that an explosion is coming . 
I do not presume to understand the course of my life . 
- For my boys and me . 
Maybe one day you will . 
all the things you 've done , all the people you 've done them to . 
Looks like we don 't have much of a choice . 
I honestly didn 't know . 
Sir , please don 't mock me . 
Attracted to the scent of rotting meat . 
We 're on it . 
You could have killed yourself . 
Why do we judge the Kaiju on a category system ? 
Spider 's not on the main lines . 
I 'm just saying we 've been rushed off our feet , Billy . 
Good , bye-bye . 
- I can 't believe I 'm going to meet him . 
What happened to him ? 
Not until you understand , really understand who it is you 're married to . 
I 'm okay . 
- You want something Lieutenant ? 
It was a Trojan horse inside of a Trojan horse . 
That was great . 
I won 't be marrying Ser Loras . 
I 'm a man who lives as woman , 
Your father cried And your mother died 
What are you doing ? 
- My Lord , please . 
A little funny . 
Just figure you could use some coffee , is all . 
Please ? 
- No explanation necessary . 
But I don 't blame you . 
Well , for whatever reason , the serpent entered . 
This should give you access to the crawlspace . 
- Ellen ? 
Go . 
- Should l ram him ? 
Really ? 
" and aufpunkt one degree west . " 
All right , give me your arm . 
Hi boys ! 
She quit ? 
Which enzyme catalyzed ? 
Yeah , all right . 
We had a female-impersonation act . 
You want to tell me how you even know about that ? 
It 's Scott . 
We 're bringing in a specialist . 
You still need a hospital . 
Get back in your corner ! 
- Nora ! 
I think it 's safe to say that nobody here is gonna be splitting the atom , Marty . 
That we play . 
and I failed . 
I think ... 
Make sure it doesn 't lead back to us . 
- Stop . 
And when you discover what you 've missed out on , in about a year , you 're gonna regret it for the rest of your life . 
I was just watching this a couple of weeks ago . 
Who buried them ? 
Huh ? 
And I was there earlier with a date . 
- Did you get the memory card ? 
- Just leave me alone , Max . 
Oh , Real mature ! 
What 're you doing ? 
Look , even if you don 't believe me- - 
I think we did the right thing . 
It 's possible she 's experiencing human emotions . 
You 're ungrateful 
Have you ever killed someone , Agatha ? 
Well , that won 't matter . 
We came across a friendly monster . 
- I 'm buzzing you in now . 
All right , let 's go . 
Pardon ? 
He 's been super for 14 years . 
Jessie Laurent ? 
Did you ever see the arachnid ? 
- Okay , let 's see . 
I knew this was coming , this or something like it . 
Nice work . 
- Oh , yes . 
- Single GSW , upper torso . 
Unless you and I come to some arrangement . 
- You 're not coming . 
There is a wild card in this new play . 
I 'm blind as a bat . 
Go to hell ! 
Don 't get hit too much . 
Zanotti 's ? 
Sometimes to move forward , 
Have Rigsby take his shirt off and look at his shoulder . 
Come on . 
Show you the terrain outside the walls , see how you do . 
That 's all l remember 
Professor Gellar . 
What 's his name ? 
Don 't take me so lightly ! 
Are you my man ? 
You think I can put a face 
Data coming up now . 
Because you 're special . 
That 's the great Matrix of Leadership . 
HOLD ON . 
You took the poison . 
Uh , we 're missing one , A. Only one cell here . 
We know . 
And eventually , somebody will open that door . 
He held a place of honour . 
Strike the life from her . 
That 's everything she was doing for the past three days . 
Jenny will pick the little ones up from school , don 't worry about that . 
You 've been typing in a hurry , probably , pressure on , facing a deadline . 
You live in Corey 's parents ' cabin in Tahoe ? 
I 'm working on it . 
An apple , nothing else . 
So is lying to a federal agent . 
Well , there 's no use in being anchored when you 're tied up at the dock . 
What 's the alternative ? 
Look , you can 't ... 
Exactly . 
I asked , what 's a data stack ? 
This thing is vibrating ? 
Sources indicate he 's reddington 's former bodyguard . 
- Are you married ? 
And keep on serving them . 
- Done . 
Once it gets tough , you chicken out . 
I wouldn 't be able to have you . 
Seemed to be at the center of the blackout investigation . 
Just wait out the night with us , okay ? 
- Yeah , well , I gotta file another one . 
He 's kind of a strange old hermit . 
Sorted and shelled in 20 minutes , boys . 
Moriarty ? 
So , what ? 
Including the uncensored feature length version of our show . 
- It 's humane , dipshit . 
( Matsunokouji ) Yes ~ ! 
It 's about my mind . 
We 'll be out of work soon , I bet . 
- I told him before . 
- What do we do now ? 
Hi , honey . 
For years you 've stood by and witnessed as your colleagues have fallen . 
I do . 
How can you know this way , not that ? 
Thank you . 
When was the last time you saw Joe ?

My dad leaves a lot . 
Ben , don 't fuck with me . 
I think you know this as the old Harvard university . 
- Enough , David . 
That 's just skillsets . 
Besides , if you go now , you will be caught within 48 hours . 
There is no-one home . 
They 're beautiful . 
it is because what you seek is already in your possession . 
I 'm gonna say this one more time , buddy . 
Ben , be serious . 
I see . 
The capture of General Grievous will end this war . 
Good . 
You 're gonna kill him ? 
Oh , yeah , Sam had a thing for o " Lester here . 
Yeah , look at me , l 'm breaking it down . 
What exactly are those solutions , Ritchie ? 
Quinn , don 't leave . 
I remember when I was little and you showed up at the Narrows . 
It 's Saruman ! 
And step out . 
- Tonight ... 
This is so scary ! 
No , we can 't . 
Maybe we should just stay here , Harry . 
Oh , Jesus . 
I 've got a question for you , Master Bruce . 
And I can 't be alone , Ginger . 
How would I be able to do that ? 
I appreciate you looking out . 
And I can give it to you in one second . 
Too far . 
Why did you name your comet after my mother ? 
Well , I 'm coming with you . 
No , I 'm just here on a vacation . 
And this is your compostela . 
Didn 't even pass our field assessments , for God 's sake ! 
He confessed to providing you with biopsy tissue . 
Peaceful night . 
You wanna tell me what 's going on here , son ? 
Come take a good look at these three people . 
Where is your next target ? 
What have you folks done to her ? 
That 's right . 
But Sharon said " be easy . " Said she 'd handle it . 
Nelson , Wood and I feel terrible how we left things at Akbar last night . 
Look right there . 
That suggests the victim may have suffered from lupus . 
Do you think you 're the first people to come after my daughter ? 
My clothes were ripped . 
it was quite the tour of your facility , doctor . 
Broker , your daughter 's on the radio . 
Where are you going , Sun ? 
How do I get it off ? 
Well . 
You 're a walking lie detector , and I just realized this is a fucking minefield . 
He received a package at this table today . 
As opposed to wanting what we want when we want it . 
[ Were you surprised by the sudden letter ? 
There 's actually somebody who might know . 
When it 's clear , I 'll bring you in . 
We 'll get back on the kid when I get my feet under me . 
Don 't get involved . 
Take a look at him now . 
Oh , that 's the house here . 
I expect you off campus by tomorrow . 
- May I ? 
I told you , you had the wrong guy . 
I 'm gonna be in that area . 
Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard . 
Don 't you ever say that again ... ever . 
- What 's wrong ? 
You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty well , didn 't you , Mercedes ? 
Yo , get your hands of my chips . 
That would be my sister . 
About anything . 
I was just talking about you . 
I don 't think you 're going to kill me . 
She 'll serve time . 
Why would I kill Archie ? 
We 're not even getting excited . 
You 're smarter than they are . 
So going down probably isn 't an option . 
Every moment I count away from you is a blessing . " 
this morning . 
- I 'm right here . 
The police searched the place , they cannot find him . 
I said to Bucky , " good for her . 
- May I speak to Rachel , please ? 
- Yeah . 
Seriously , Emily , look at me . 
A car ... you know what I like . 
But in bed , he 's no gentleman . 
- Got you . 
Put out your hand . 
It 's a scary world out there . 
- E-mail us . 
- Weren 't you sleeping on it ? 
He won 't wake . 
- North . 
This one 's labeled " Susan . " 
Samaritan found the terrorist . 
I 'm done . 
Jesus ... your dad is a congressman . 
Is that where this leads ? 
She was distracted , she wasn 't giving it her all ? 
I don 't want any trouble if you don 't come back . 
Wow , jury 's gonna love that one . 
You people are amateurs compared to him . 
Well , not all of them . 
Imagine the technology we can find on that ship . 
Requires quite a bit of contortion . 
Easily traceable ? 
Oh , fuck . 
Good night . 
You understand me ? 
Let 's go to the mines , far from here . 
When things got truly miserable between us , 
- Shut the fuck up ! 
She was a good kid . 
You should knock , Ms. Warren . 
You see who that was ? 
I 'll get it . 
Quiet and nasty . 
Why would Todd want to be with you ? 
People will die without that medicine ! 
You were the stronger one . 
All right ? 
You shot Roscoe ! 
Yeah , probably worried you 'd report it . 
Like in church ? 
If you don 't , your friends die . 
Do you know how ? 
I know this is a big deal for you and me , 
One phone call , triple your salary . 
Hey , I 'm not going anywhere . 
You sound like my college girlfriend . 
Any time soon ? 
- You didn 't believe him . 
We have no resources , John .

and I tol ... 
May I come and visit with you at your home ? 
You were about to cause a scene trying to get into this fucking place . 
- I had a migraine , so I took ... 
Your rational mind can 't make sense of your loss . 
Like finding a drop of water in a creek . 
I felt anything since I came back . 
Joe brought it . 
This is so terrible . 
What do you mean investors ? 
Mine , too . 
- You 're confusing me with someone who gives a damn . 
- I have another surprise for you . 
Well , I mean , I guess I could , but ... 
Why didn 't you call the police ? 
Will Graham has asked to see me . 
I really cannot accept that . 
But you 'll find your way . 
Empty vassal . 
I can 't take this shit no more . 
I know it . 
And what decision is that ? 
No . " The Lord is good . 
No ... no . 
I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Rich . 
You are an amazing cop . 
Already have . 
Is that why they were all looking at me that way ? 
Turn right and follow to the end . 
- No ! 
Security cameras ? 
Cheers to that . 
- Busted . 
You know what you have to do . 
- Where you running , man ? 
And in return , he was supposed to transfer my profits electronically . 
- Impossible . 
It 's great to be back . 
I wanna have his adopted babies . 
The elite ? 
I never wait for tables . 
With training ? 
- What happened ? 
Yankee ! 
May I first ask you a question ? 
You will confess and you will die . 
Of course , Jimmy 's at big school now , isn 't he ? 
Saakashvili started this war ! 
Tell me what happened , Hannibal . 
So I think if we use these ... 
Dorothy is a real stickler . 
We 're doing everything in our power to catch these guys . 
I got 30 minutes . 
You 're gonna what ? 
You didn 't even mention my baby . 
A warrior , of the jarhead clan . 
Ladies and gentlemen , we 're about to begin our descent . 
I 'm sorry that I have been so distant lately . 
Is that right ? 
You shot me in my foot ! 
Because there 's about to be some grown-woman shit up in here tonight ! 
Lord , I swear the only time this happens is when I put the top down . 
It is divine ! 
They found this thing in 150 square kilometers of Norwegian forest . 
- Don 't talk like that , mucker . 
- So it seems . 
Where 'd you get your law degree , Goodman ? 
Hold that . 
What is it ? 
They have given us no cause to doubt their loyalty . 
Your mother wasn 't quite so enthusiastic . 
It 's new . 
No , you won 't . 
No , it 's not nothing . 
I should get some sleep . 
No , no . 
Gone ! 
I have no-no gripes with you at all , okay ? 
Of a guy who knows a woman that might know a programmer ... 
Let me see .

Ms. Hasan . 
What the hell is this about ?

Evan , yeah ! 
But do you wanna see the house where I grew up ? 
Can you fill us in on the rest of that list , Jesse ? 
Part of which was you resume your normal lifestyle . 
That assumption is further substantiated by the presence of a dog at the scene of the crime . 
Where ? 
Come on . 
Are they so different ? 
In my o ...

You 're supposed to be dead . 
He said he was headed to the vault to prepare a shipment .

Let me look .

Knock off the bullshit and pull yourselves together . 
But spring came and I received a letter from you . 
What is he trying to do ? 
And who are you ? 
Okay , and , uh , this blends in ?

- Explain what ? 
Exactly . 
Well , this is it . 
Spartan 0-1 , Spartan base . 
No more . 
But he 's gonna live ? 
And whatever they 're gonna do to the humans , 
Well , you never said who your best friend is . 
Well , 11 years to be exact . 
That 's not true . 
I never saw any hand , fake or otherwise . 
- Mom . 
Locke 's got her , too , and we know where he 's heading . 
I 'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother 's . 
Jeremy gave me money to fix it . 
Tomorrow at noon , we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history . 
I don 't blame you , you 're driving . 
More like Body by Upchuck . 
Sure she 's dying to . 
I don 't understand . 
How could I pass up the chance to eat the best ribs in Washington ? 
The bull-in-the-china shop routine might have worked when you were stealing gumballs ,

He 's in the French Quarter . 
If there 's something else , Mace , I have a right to know . 
I have a feeling , too .

We do live in the great melting pot . 
It 's a real pleasure to meet you . 
There are safeguards , proprietary safeguards that I 'll put in place ! 
Lori , did you ... 
Welcome to Lake Balaton . 
Asshole ! 
You can call me Goldie . 
Have you fucked anyone ? 
I gave you a command forbidding you to take revenge . 
What is it ? 
I think I got something .

The question is , by who ? 
The Jacob that you carried in your belly . 
Suppose I call the cops ...

I can put my mind to policy , but I 'm no good at this brand of politics . 
- I need answers , man . 
What 'd they give you ? 
You know that friend you told me about in the stables ? 
Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere ? 
Either the Martins or the videotape . 
This way .

I 'm sorry , that came out very wrong . 
Look , I just called to tell him that I need a little extra . 
He stole my coat ! 
Till I can find a way to get off this farm , I have to settle for books .

I can 't believe I slept in . 
Because no one messes with Ramone Santiago ! 
It 's not enough , damn it . 
Everything 's stuck behind a cloud .

YOU CAN DO FOR ME , MR. JACK ? 
Do not let it go , okay ? 
Look , I never had what you had with mom and dad , okay ? 
- No , I don 't like that thing . 
That wouldn 't be hard . 
I 'm clearance level six . 
Abu Nazir . 
He is my own . 
So you 're working on a case ? 
Just stay quiet . 
That was so awesome ! 
No , no ... 
Ring the bell three times , put your helmet on the ground . 
I hope you 'll forgive me , too , Toki . 
It 's more romantic . 
There is a storm coming . 
Go on , off you go . 
Mr Bauer , you say an attack is imminent . 
In my century , there are energy cells the size of a coin . 
And Yuji believes that story as well ?

Oh , shit , I 'm pregnant again ! 
You need to let her go . 
Do better . 
No , thank you . 
Yeah , speaking of which , where the fuck is Vince ?

Which is how you learned all those nasty things about me . 
You stay out of my way and we all get what we want .

This is fucking sick ! 
Hey , Dave . 
We 're from New York and we ... 
How can you wager on this when you control the outcome ? 
I don 't know , but nobody 's allowed to leave until the show is over . 
By history , I mean , something that is not 2000 years old . 
It 's called trust ! 
It was time . 
I didn 't want anyone to know what I was doing here , or why I required you . 
Brave men and women fighting for their freedom . 
Well , my " mask " is about to get his teeth kicked in . 
That doesn 't even make any sense . 
And don 't you think my esteemed colleagues could 've come up with something just a little more believable ? 
Just maybe not in the next few days . 
Where are we going ? 
They liked to train them from scratch .

I 'm so glad you came . 
Hands where I can see them ! 
I knew you weren 't Betty . 
She 's gonna need a lung transplant , isn 't she ? 
- Yes . 
You seriously have a problem with me not drinking , after what happened ? 
Killer left her identification for us . 
You hired me to do a job . 
You gonna make jemma an honest woman , huh ? 
It 's not as serious as you might think . 
He did too much . 
I will vouch for her , her people , and her dragons in accordance with the law . 
No danger of that .

Got to have dreams , bro . 
She 's out there fighting for our cause . 
It 's about to begin . 
I have a friend who would love that . 
I 'm truly grateful for your help . 
I hope those bastards won 't sniff out our cargo .

" Thanks anyway , sir , but my friends are still stealing cargo back there . " 
That 's funny . 
OK , folks , let 's get back to the gaming table , shall we ?

Possibly a Level One terrorist . 
You may have been exploring how he killed to better understand who he was .

You 're truly a man . 
It 's impressive . 
It 's amazing . 
I do a lot of things . 
I hope I never see you again .

Then sleep with me . 
That okay ? 
- Since when do you tell the enemy when he has won ? 
The remnants of the Dumas family were forced to change their name . 
Baked beans , buff wings , butter . 
And I think this was , too . 
So why 'd you kill her ? 
No less than 120 and you don 't have to ride with a stinking corpse , neither . 
I got a present for you . 
We 'll have six or seven . 
But we 've come all this way . 
Be cheerful , boy . 
That 's no good . 
It wasn 't no big deal .

What happened ? 
I cannot find a link between the two . 
Join your warriors . 
What bites a zombie ? 
It 's very deep , and I have no idea what it means . 
So was I. 
One of you is blindfolded , and you share one tank . 
We 're registered with the FDA . 
I 've loved you since I was a boy . 
What are you waiting for ? 
At close quarters ? 
Put it with the others . 
Why are you being like this ? 
What do you need ? 
Get out of here ! 
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don 't know you anymore . 
Come here . 
Didn 't paralyze him . 
my 1.5lakh worth sherwani !

Oh , my God ... 
" If you watch it , you die . " 
- Prim ! 
Does that make any sense ? 
Lily 's mother and me are kind of a- - a fling ! 
Vampires really jam on sewer systems . 
You must find it . 
- Did Control meet Riemeck ? 
And then he burned you up ... 
I lose more friends this way . 
Maybe the real killer would be in prison ... and the inspector would still have his job . 
We 'll contact you within the next week . 
I 'd like to go to China too . 
Can 't shoot ? 
How can you be sure he 's not goading you ? 
A crime of passion . 
The Angel took the bait . 
My husband likes to be prepared for emergencies . 
And after devouring it in one sitting ... 
Like a car backfired ? 
Goldfish ? 
Fine . 
To do this , I must become someone else . 
She didn 't know it was a fake , of course , 
Three more on my shift threatened to quit today . 
This is going to be an entirely new experience . 
She 's new here as well . 
So glad your house is made out of wood . 
You don 't need to do anything . 
I appreciate your loyalty . 
One other thing .

... to get this building up and running or the bank takes it . 
No , they don 't exist . 
Isn 't that an officer 's uniform ? 
- I don 't have a gun . 
And I took all of her money . 
Now you listen to me very carefully Mr 47 , or whatever the fuck your name is . 
It would be a minor surgery . 
The cover I created for you won 't hold up . 
That I might fancy a little buggering from a fine young dandy like yourself ? 
There 's blood on your coat there . 
We done , Viggo ? 
I don 't see anything . 
You know , I got a buddy of mine in that industry . 
Better , huh ? 
Hoped this would be the last place they 'd think to look . 
Wasn 't there a guy who used to run the Traders with you ? 
A secretary . 
You 're one of the Avengers , man . 
Invite him to the party . 
Guess you could say that I 've decided to go back to school . 
Suppose I put you in a venture that was low-risk , but very high-yield . 
So don 't do her . 
- Don 't you go . 
This is really far east . 
I understand why you want to quit , Harold . 
Smith , Suran , Clegg , take two agents , you cover the rear alley . 
As a matter of fact , I have . 
- Crap . 
- Okay , l see your point ! 
Who 's my opponent ? 
It means a lot , coming from him . 
Yeah , there 's a chapel by the Western gate .

I won 't be , not after all this ! 
- Now where is he ? 
He 's playing Paganini 's , uh , 24 Caprices , 
Just let these people go . 
I gave her one of my sleeping pills . 
How would he even know that we 're still alive ? 
My chances are just as good as yours . 
I 'm supposed to be working . 
I 'm feeling hungry today . 
Long enough to know you 're getting nowhere solving my sons murder . 
No , uh , they 're just calling to check in . 
The government has a secret system- - a machine that spies on you every hour of every day . 
So give me the letter , pack up your shit and ... 
I have to ask , have we ever met before ? 
Come on , come on , come on . 
One was brought into the morgue . 
Maybe the third man just wanted it to look that way . 
Before he finds out . 
Just get me what I need .

Over here ! 
Where 's your friend ? 
Yeah , but what do you think ? 
- Put down your weapons . 
Hei Jordan . 
Some rich guy calls you on the phone . 
What 's up ? 
I warned you not to screw me over .

I 'm your sister ! 
I think I 'm gonna be sick . 
How many months what ? 
About my life . 
What if they see us ? 
I did 
Well , did she report it ? 
It was an accident . 
That was when I used to live with my brother , Bernard . 
The money stays , though . 
What did he mean by the flames of war ? 
Ah , damn it . 
Do as he says . 
I haven 't seen him since . 
Did we ? 
Just sit tight , alright ? 
- What are you saying ? 
Hey , lover boy . 
Come on . 
- Wait a minute . 
You see that ? 
Well , she 's only been dead a week , right ? 
She told a newspaper that " God landed that plane " . 
Mr. Vice president , terrorists are in control of the white house . 
- Her name is Marie . 
This is Major Stance . 
She wanted to testify and they made an example of her . 
I knew they hit your stash house . 
Can we be alone , mom ? 
One of you is going to die . 
When I carried you to the film vault , 
- What did you come for ? 
Expected to find your resignation on my desk this morning . 
It 's more fun over there . 
I don 't know what I was thinking . 
I 'm gonna catch up with that coward soon enough . 
Self-defense system protocol initiated . 
What 'd I order ? 
That 's what friends are for 
I won 't change my mind . 
Course you did . 
Standing by . 
For real ? 
You can 't do this on your own . 
I did my homework . 
I 'm Reese , shoot him ! 
Would you like to watch me ?

While guests are not here , tell Pyotr what 's happening in the world . 
Why , Evan ?

Let 's go outside . 
A great responsibility rests upon each of you . 
- You 're Theon Greyjoy . 
Thanks again for the food . 
Crazy assholes . 
Richard had it so hard growing up . 
It 's one of these three here . 
Could it be a motive for murder ? 
There 's nowhere to hide . 
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are ? 
As I wish that I could help the young woman who visited earlier ... 
At least I 'm doing something . 
She left me in charge and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason . 
A young boy . 
What does that have to do with the fund-raiser ? 
Everyone fantasizing that I got my MBA while I was on the island ? 
You 're a good guy . 
You should see a doctor . 
Is it okay if he spends the night ? 
Cheap bastard . 
All right . 
Yes , I see it . 
And see me ... 
- What 's going on ? 
I knew I wouldn 't have to . 
I 'm Kato . 
Turn your goddamn intercom off if you 're gonna bawl like that . 
- He did not win . 
Anastasia , I 'd like you to meet our new intern , 
I 'm glad you finally found some peace . 
Oh , come on . 
You do good work . 
- Of fuck ! 
I 'm sorry . 
He fancies himself Edgar Allan Poe . 
Notice her relaxed body language , 
How do you feel ?

The Visa machine 's acting up . 
And their cortisol levels go through the roof ! 
You miserable black dogs stand like the deef and dumb . 
The men must sleep on the swamp while they 're hunting . 
You do it every morning . 
You 're welcome . 
- Goodbye . 
I want him out . 
Look who 's talkin ' . 
I 'm old and limping and you want me to help him ? 
- A small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young women for the rest of their lives . 
When is the strike going to occur ? 
he wished me well and left . 
Jesus Christ , man . 
Commodore , l beg you , please do this . 
It 's important . 
Then we 're worse off than we were before . 
And because of him , we get Columbus day off from school . 
Do you think we killed him ? 
It 's all right , Addy . 
Aren 't I ? 
- 17 meters . 
It was ' 86 . 
I understand it 's been a rough couple of days . 
I 'm no leader . 
Don 't think you can pull one over on me , Doctor . 
You could have elephants , and the bride and groom can walk on a little tightrope . 
You 've got a license ? 
God , I 'm a terrible liar . 
He knew we 'd come here . 
I 'll do my best . 
You lost your mind ? 
And state your address for the tape . 
This smile wasn 't cheap . 
To the ting to the tang The wallawalla bingbang

Hell must have prepared you well . 
It can 't be looked at solely with a scientific mind . 
So the Denalis ' mother made an Immortal Child ? 
Not more than Enterprise can spare . 
No , if you say I haven 't . 
Yeah , I would be if I didn 't have to answer inane questions . 
Where is Ang Dorjee and Lopsang ? 
Monsters are coming , Mr. Mayor . 
Well , you 'd have more chance digging to China with a teaspoon . 
Let us see if she 's immune to all our powers . 
Please . 
Oh , you 're not thinking , Henry . 
- Tense them . 
But I was too late . 
What was the last year and a half of your life like ? 
I ordered him to leave it alone . 
- Okay . 
Hey , it 's you again . 
Fresh eggs !

We didn 't do anything , alright ? 
- Shoot him ! 
Oh , I 'll drive . 
After all , you are the guest 
Welcome back . 
Couldn 't get close enough to do it himself . 
AND DOWN ... 
You wanted to go through the trench . 
I would send ambulances . 
Something happened at the lab today . 
I think you 're the man to blame for all this . 
Only if it 's really hard 
He could see what no one else could . 
Watch what happens .

Goddamn thing won 't fucking start . 
What kind of man crawled into his own grave in search of hope , hm ? 
You can 't look at other people 's children .

Five minutes . 
The truth is you are not very smart . 
That 's the engineer . 
See , this is the reason why we 're losing . 
In case you reconsider . 
He made sure that heart didn 't beat very long . 
I wish I never even heard of it . 
Then why in tarnation did you bring it here ? 
What 's the use of talking to those who won 't believe you ? 
No sign of Firefly .

He wasn 't worried about me . 
I didn 't think it could get any worse . 
Oh , yeah ! 
People were saying he was selling the corpses to the university over in Essex County . 
Walter 's being kept . 
I took you off the street .

I hope the old man got the tractor beam down . 
You couldn 't help it . 
And he 's using you to help him . 
So you think I killed the weasel ? 
- May have to . 
First task is to get to Mechanicsville , find Anne and Lexie . 
That 's great news for GREATM . 
Charlie did indeed have a lover here . 
You gotta plant both your feet on the ground and start livin ' life .

Percy called us a group . 
And smile . 
I 'm gonna call you back . 
That was supposed to be destroyed . 
Help ! 
Hey , Lee , put those in the office . 
You know , to keep the skeleton . 
He should 've at least texted you back . 
Thanks for your help , Moss . 
Respectfully , sir ,

Maybe he had an appointment . 
We 're talking about an extremely virulent pathogen . 
Chillax , Doug , we 're all adults here .

Katniss !

So long ago . 
Now I know why . 
Well , where did they think you got it from ? 
You goddamn coward ! 
But if you 're just a machine ... 
I never even saw a pair of headlights . 
- Stu , do you want this or not ? 
That 's the best offer I 've had today . 
You understand that ? 
You 're all I have left to live for . 
So now we 're trapped in Fischer 's mind , battling his own private army . 
With their drones ? 
When this starts going , it 's all ... 
When she smiles , do people give her shit and say , " Oh , my God ! 
Hey , don 't cry . 
I think I 'll take my chances . 
Τhank you .

Coming up with an answer for everything I say . 
But do you see that ? 
Establish a standard perimeter and set up a class " A " alert by sundown .

Yeah but wasn 't Marilyn , like , 36 when she died ? 
That 's a beautiful child .

You know where he 's taking them ? 
[ Crying ] 
This is a restricted area . 
Happy for you . 
- She 's dying . 
What kind of message ? 
How did you know ? 
Ms. Harper 's friend from the dorm , Trey . 
Yeah , we were neighbors . 
Well , what do you know ? 
That 's a very sensitive subject for me . 
- Kid , I 'll get by . 
He wouldn 't . 
Sam never mentioned him before ? 
Get Alby inside . 
Do it . 
These are not my things . 
Except there were no flames . 
She stopped for drinks with some friends . 
A precious thing like you will look very , very good . 
Sit down with me , darling .

Probably some sort of a , you know , aftereffect . 
I came here when I was 14 with a life expectancy of 13 . 
Try changing your point of view . 
Yes , you do . 
If he wants to take stuff to the other side he already can .

All right , thanks .

She can 't give birth with you being so loud 
And that 's if you 're lucky . 
You need to back off . 
I wanted to do something for myself , you know ? 
Together . 
Well , what 's next on the agenda ? 
This is Brazil . 
A bicycle . 
Now they come . 
You 're beginning to bug me . 
Uh , probably best not to ignore those . 
That wasn 't easy . 
It tasted like metal . 
The roads are so bad , my love . 
I think they fry the onions in hair oil .

Someone 's building androids . 
Why would Bruni do this ? 
Oh I see . 
He 's coming up on heavy traffic . 
You saved my life , Captain . 
Somebody 's going to get hurt !

You can put this on now , please .

You 're not a killer , Frederick . 
You been looking for a fight . 
I love you , hon . 
Some of the poison did get into his system . 
Oh , shit ! 
What have we got ? 
Mother of a 13-year-old boy shot to death with her own gun . 
All right , so what did he say exactly ? 
Sure . 
The stink - somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel . 
It 's only getting worse out there . 
I feel shitty enough about Aayan as it is . 
The vocal chords were chemically treated , similar to how catgut string is treated . 
- Dad ? 
I swear to God I 'll shoot him ! 
The second mole would see and alert Amanda . 
[ Lydia ] Bob ? 
Our mission is Mexico . 
Everything is quiet here . 
- Hey , I 've been thinking .

To have someone you love just vanish from your life . 
I turned around to take your order , and you were just gone . 
Neighbor said he 's some kind of art dealer . 
Master Yoda . 
The road to Volantis ? 
Oh , no . 
You gotta keep up . 
Put your hands behind your back . 
Afghanistan or Turkey ? 
Look , there he goes , isn 't he dreamy ? 
Where you going ? 
Wait here . 
- You sure about that ? 
A little . 
And how would they even know ? 
She was beautiful and smart and kind . 
Just not as much as you feel for someone else . 
Can you remember your name ? 
But when we go tonight , Andrew , can I give you , like , a pro tip ? 
If the world were just ... 
Ok , I 'll do it ! 
It 's a force of habit . 
– Do it , walk ! 
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard who made such excellent fireworks ? 
We 're going to start all over again . 
This one 's long since dead . 
He 's pretty charismatic . 
And the truth is , you 're not a little girl anymore . 
- Oh , there 's hours yet . 
Think of it as an exchange , Sandra . 
I like you , too , Ian . 
What are you doing with all this gear ' ? 
No , sir , it 's not . 
He didn 't think I knew what he was getting , but I did . 
That Kaiju is still alive !

I went to court . 
And you completely lose your head .

Bruce 's father gave me very firm orders was him and his missus to die . 
My sister 's a testament to that . 
My dear child , where have you been ? 
We were this close to getting laid .

New billboard went up on Sunset . 
Why don 't you just let that go to voicemail ?

I can feel it . 
Do what ? 
Uh , yeah , I do . 
We 're going to have a baby . 
Get it over . 
He 's been planning this for a while . 
Hey , fuckwad , are you taking the scenic route ? 
Can anybody hear my voice ? 
I 'm not a machine . 
Well , we are not gonna celebrate without him . 
To battle , to battle , sons of Durin ! 
Too bad it is six floors down . 
You are very right . 
He 's creating urgency . 
Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become . 
Slow down ! 
Okay . 
And l get up there and l weave this web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing , 
Look , here 's my card . 
Wait ! 
Quit fucking around and get out of there . 
You ever miss it ? 
I was getting a napkin for my drink . 
It 's my life , and I 'll decide what to do with it . 
... fifty thousand pounds . 
Someone told the sturmbahnfuhrer about my cats . 
Nice entrance . 
- Why ? 
Like ... over lunch ? 
IN A SUBWAY STATION ... 
You both feeling okay ? 
You know , a knife ? 
Hey ... he 's gone , man . 
Most boys would be sleeping for days after a seizure like that . 
You have a wife , two kids . 
It won 't do any good . 
I never talked to him after what happened with Stephania . 
Christ , you 're a babe . 
You can stay as long as you 'd like . 
How you feeling ? 
I won 't leave you here . 
I promised them I 'd find you . 
I know what you have done . 
There was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us or kill us . 
I hope he can recover soon 
- Susan ? 
You hide a great many things : 
Cause we 're dead ... 
They make me call , I call . 
Don 't give up , even if things happen that you don 't like . 
You 're Mexican . 
Yeah , it is a puzzle by any measure . 
We 're not sending maids ! 
If all of a sudden they were left to fend for themselves like animals . 
That 's only 15nm . 
If I were you , I 'd want to be on that boat within the hour . 
Ain 't nothin ' thicker than blood . 
You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death ? 
We 're going ! 
Honey , I 've been around cattle all my working life . 
A momentary lapse in judgment . 
Probably packing ' armor too . 
Ms. Shaw ? 
Do you remember your name yet ? 
And you are . 
He 's just someone I can 't get rid of . 
I 'm just enjoying myself in this shrinking box . 
42 meters a second . 
I 'm with Immigration and Customs Enforcement . 
You 're home . 
You 're not even holding a gun . 
I have no choice but to wish it every success . 
I mean , the obvious is , uh , the overuse of cologne . 
Feel its power . 
I need three more clips of 5.56 ... eight grenades and an extra battery . 
And I didn 't see any arrows laying around . 
We deal with death every day here , but not like that . 
- John , what 's going on ? 
It 's adorable just how wrong you are . 
What do you see ? 
Experience ? 
Sean , what are you doing ? 
What makes you say that ? 
The key to repeat business ... ls new business . 
V.N.X. Energy . 
Yeah , you did . 
He hardly ever sleeps . 
How long have I been out ? 
No , I 'm not the one who gave you up . 
It 's like a firewall against leaks . 
She wanted to kill you . 
You 're not the first . 
I was hungry . 
You got to find some place safe and hide . 
I don 't think that 'll be necessary , but thank you . 
Show some respect , boy ! 
UR ALIVE ? 
How you feeling ? 
Get him downstairs now . 
Would you look at that ? 
It 's a dance . 
She thanked me for my assistance . 
Opportunity . 
How many wizards are there in this damned world ? 
I don 't know what 's going on with her . 
When Jeb asks , you do what he says . 
Mom , if what you 're saying is true , then ... 
What are you waiting for ? 
- Hey , guys , we need hoses . 
- What about that other angry dude ? 
I 'm very impressed by you . 
Yeah , and people in hell want slurpees . 
You let me know when it 's tight enough . 
Sponsored by ? 
- I 'm not afraid of your dare , Fabrigo 
Roll down your window , will you ? 
No mistakes . 
It was sustained . 
I wouldn 't do anything to hurt her . 
I switched the SIM card in your phone to make sure it matched . 
I 'm really gonna miss you tomorrow . 
I was hanging out with my roommate till about 9 : 00 or so . 
I 'm going to need tech support to cross-reference your files . 
I never asked anything of the world . 
I really feel like , with a firm such as this , sir , that I ... 
Somebody 's going to have to make the hard choice , if we 're going to get out of here alive . 
And why are you happy ? 
I don 't think so . 
A bomb is not a bomb when it 's a misfire . 
Go ! 
All right , so who 's our big bad , huh ? 
Anyway , night 's not over yet . 
Lord Walder ! 
No , your job is protecting him . 
We need to burn the bodies . 
Hostage name . 
- Yeah . 
- You gonna be okay ? 
What is this ? 
Also , any statements he has made will be considered having been made under duress . 
This was my mother 's . 
Sit , stall , stil . 
You imprinted on my daughter ? 
- Nobody . 
You mean for not letting you push me away ? 
Well , it 's clearly an overdose . 
Bauer , you took it from the evidence pouch . 
How can you live like this ? 
How about l pick you up at the diner at 8 : 00 ? 
I need to know where it is , and Kevin goes to the hospital . 
It 's the fucking end of the world . 
Oh , look , there 's my car ! 
Listen to me . 
Angels from heaven . 
Let 's make some deductions together . 
Um , a couple of days . 
- And now is the right time ? 
Okay , that place was kind of freaky but how are you gonna know until you see for yourself ? 
So , clap your hands . 
Catchy name . 
Oh , you 're ... 
You 've got to go through the system to get treatment . 
Not following you . 
- Yes ! 
You said if I did that , I 'd get people killed , so , your choice . 
All right . 
I 'm walking towards the fridge . 
Go away . 
What 's wrong ? 
Compromising one 's principles for the greater good is not a shameful act . 
Busy , busy ! 
- No , you listen . 
Likewise . 
But I 'd still rather be the farmer with the rifle . 
If this is your way of protecting me- - 
They don 't run on diesel . 
I know where this is going . 
Alpha , to follow . 
You and Carol and Rick will help everyone till they get back .

We now turn to the hostile nation of North Korea . 
What about the fiancÃ © e ? 
Let 's go . 
( Sighs ) All right . 
Hardly consider a penis pump sophisticated equipment . 
Oh , just too many fags , that 's all . 
You can 't ... 
But do I lash out , Paulie ? 
Oh , so many stars . 
Let me just get these to-go . 
I was weak . 
Thanks , babe . 
No , we 're not . 
Are you sure this thing even works ? 
I walked . 
Hello , son . 
- Oh ! 
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm : 
- Ah , Christ . 
Stop it ! 
You see what our great allies , the Volm , are doing now ? 
Yeah , this is it . 
Hi , oh , gosh , it 's ... 
- What is going on here ? 
What was the ship carrying , Snowy ? 
And I wouldn 't wanna be old when he gets here . 
Come on . 
Remind me again why I don 't want to go to prison ?

Are they scared of me ? 
" And see the world in endless sleep ... 
Birdbrain ! 
Men with guns should be arriving any second . 
He 'll let you go home ? 
Let me get this straight . 
That 's sort of comforting . 
He 's in Silent Hill . 
Daddy , I knew I 'd see you again . 
We could steal from her , while not causing any damage . 
Okay , talk to you later . 
How did you die ? 
So ? 
And you will , and you will . 
These are delicious . 
Sir , you 're breaking up . 
I 'm so sorry 
- And his child . 
When ? 
There 's got to be a compliment in there somewhere . 
A-globe ? 
- Steph , what are you doing ? 
My name is classified . 
No ... no . 
Is that a first name ? 
You 'd better . 
If you proceed with interbreeding . 
Third from the top , muzzle flash . 
For what ? 
No ! 
What 's the rest of the code say ? 
That 's a bit cumbersome , isn 't it ? 
I found out my parents were ... 
HOW DID YOU GET THE INVITATION TO MY PARTY ? 
Updating your will ? 
Suddenly interested in her studies ? 
Want to talk to you out " live aboard . " Tyler ... 
I was done . 
Yeah , I don 't think so . 
Just looking for a little crystal meth . 
Wait ! 
Save 30,000 phone calls or the life of one boy . 
So I 'm assuming , from the absence of his body , that Mr. Charles survived . 
It 's okay , Papa . 
We 'll get to her . 
One thousand eighty-four . 
Killers hate to leave their trophies behind . 
While I was cleaning graffiti off the toilet walls , 
Did you take what was yours then ? 
- Improvised explosive device . 
We 'd received radio transmissions from there . 
Go . 
Carstairs , now approaching . 
You coming ? 
Maybe freeze-dry them and hand them out to the poor as sustenance . 
They are my cousins . 
Please , be careful . 
Something that cooks . 
How long is this gonna take ? 
Grab her ! 
I need you here . 
When everything started , Dawn reported to a guy named Hanson . 
I 'd never believe anything a cop said . 
Don 't get up on account of me . 
Don 't tell me you 're bloody squeamish . 
No one will separate us again . 
Remember you sent some wildcatters out into the middle of nowhere last week ? 
I hate this fucking song ! 
- Oompa-Loompas ? 
You must be the new guy . 
He seems a little off . 
Well , what if I did ? 
About sprinting all the time . 
Christie , you don 't have to get upset . 
Well , initially , one might experience a feeling of paranoia and a growing sense of dread . 
Okay . 
All right , let 's give it a go . 
I 'm not going anywhere . 
You don 't know what you 're promising . 
Hey . 
Okay . 
And if Mathison tries anything again ... 
You defended her ? 
She never mentioned a village being massacred ? 
Once we go in , we don 't come out till that nigga 's dead . 
So help us , and we 'll make this mess go away a lot faster . 
I knew that I had to either arrive with the device or evidence that the device existed . 
I 'm looking for Detective Nathaniel Kim . 
Traffickers , cartels . 
Work being first amongst them . 
Did you just smell me ? 
Dahl , get your sniper rifle and barium rounds now . 
And Hatake is not gonna be in charge of this place forever . 
That hurts me when you speak to me in a passive-aggressive way . 
That 's the kid we 've been waiting for . 
Oh , wait , do you have your keys ? 
Of course , I didn 't know it was a gunshot at the time . 
Just don 't tell Dad . 
Get in the car ! 
I didn 't think it was relevant . 
( laughs ) I love you , too . 
Finch , there 's no sign of danger in here , not counting the shrimp puffs . 
Like what ? 
I 'm not a scientist ! 
I remember seeing people standing in line overnight just to get their hands on one of these . 
Suit yourself , no matter . 
I suggest you hear what he has to say before lynching him . 
Drive until I tell you to turn . 
- Think so .

Romeo and Juliet . 
I go to my hearing , you continue to play with your bones , and we keep digging . 
Thanks to you , our race survives . 
Oh , sorry . 
I am not ashamed .

Christine 's dead . 
Micheal and I are having a baby .

Good one . 
And let me just say this ... 
There 's always a cash flow problem . 
I 'm beginning to think you 're bad luck .

- Gotta be a better ending than that ! 
It is over , you piece of shit . 
What the fuck is going on here ? 
Was it a long time ago ? 
Spare Oom . 
- Well , does that high school have a chem lab ? 
They don 't ask me any questions . 
I 've already gone off them . 
- Yeah ? 
They will release us , man . 
That 's why I have to open your eyes to the truth . 
We all know ! 
You were at the execution . 
.. but I can 't get your people out . 
I got no place else to go . 
This is ridiculous . 
Let 's talk a bit about his philosophy as a coach . 
You can , I don 't know , play with your band , have a drink with your friends ...

I 'm sorry for being so snappy this morning . 
And dark . 
This one suits me fine . 
It 's just the two-minute warning .

Yeah , I figured I 'd run for my life with everyone else .

- You know why . 
And you ? 
I said to him , " You know what ? 
There 's no threat . 
I 'm sorry about what Daniel did . 
- True . 
I 'm ... 
Look at me . 
I guess . 
Now , most of you think you know the rest of the story , but you may not . 
Besides , we didn 't tell London . 
I 'm sorry ! 
- Open your eyes ! 
Delightful creature . 
Get your car and meet me around the corner . 
She told you once before . 
Actually , I 'd like to ask a few questions . 
Of course . 
The others ... 
Yeah , it doesn 't feel good today . 
Is that what you think ? 
Uh , bless me , Father , for I have sinned . 
- Only 1 person . 
Two guys came in waving guns , emptied the register . 
You seem to lack the spine . 
There 's nothing anyone can do about it . 
God sure was dressing the wrong doll when he blessed you with a set of balls . 
Well , why do they want to talk to Jimmy about it ? 
We need one more . 
- Rubber bullet . 
It 's my daily carry , okay ? 
Go get a fucking drink maybe ?

Lieutenant Dill will assume command . 
What shame he must feel .

- Can I get you a cup of tea ? 
Sweetheart , this isn 't going to be easy to explain ...

He asks about you , how you 're doing . 
Apparently , they 've been acting like this for days . 
Hi , Jim . 
You know that 's impossible . 
Where is she , Felix ? 
- Why ?
