But slowing is not stopping . 
I 'm looking for you , samuel . 
No big deal . 
Hey , hon ? 
Fred , I don 't think- - 
it all just became so clear to me . 
History . 
And so that 's a stage , right . 
Take their attention away from the people ! 
I guess not , no . 
Occasionally , not all the time . 
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna ? 
- 500,000 going out . 
Prepare to face the fury of my vengeance . 
You all right ? 
- Uh , just from back there . 
I 've known everything from the beginning , Zoe . 
You remember that song ? 
She was covering her face . 
It 's a man 's size ten . 
What do you make of me ? 
You just sound weird . 
Whether it 's a cottage or not . 
We 're gonna have to bypass a lot of safety protocols , okay ? 
We 'll go in a few days . 
Dennis Abbott , F.B.I. you must be Patrick Jane .

The beast is gone .

I can 't sleep no more , Shawn . 
Oh , whoa ! 
I can 't stand this anymore . 
- Hi ! 
Just once would have been nice . 
You know , I come all this way just to say sorry . 
The losses you have had to suffer . 
Good . 
A gin and tonic 's pretty much a gin and tonic , no matter where you drink it . 
You should listen to your boss . 
Anyway , this is my street . 
We believe the judges and Marco 's court - appointed attorney are biased against us . 
And then nothing happened . 
I know what tha  s like . 
The ghosts appeared , summoned by their talismans . 
Listen . 
That 's a terrible idea . 
Don 't you read the blog ? 
You 've actually gone out and made one . 
- Is this a Red Flag exercise ? 
That 's how I do . 
And , this DVD is chock full of extras including a 20-minute Christmas Special that you can only get on the DVD . 
Sounded like they 'd come from inside one of the shops . 
He 's due for one later . 
Well , that 's very sweet , but don 't go overboard . 
This is it ? 
We don 't know . 
I did ? 
- You 're Nomad ? 
( CHUCKLING ) 
we couldn 't believe he would keep something like that from us . 
Well we must be somewhere . 
It 's pizza day . 
What was your final move ? 
Help me up . 
Because his journey is yours . 
You don 't cheat on Miss Hubbard County . 
- What makes you say that ? 
Did they promise you anything to serve me up ? 
Exactly . 
I put the mother of all hits on this punk . 
More like me being this way made me right for the job . 
Losing skin 's more like it . 
Why is he trying to kill us ? 
Had to send the jacket back once actually .

Is there any way that I can maybe get to it ? 
Do you miss it ? 
Have you seen my sister ? 
- Come on , Deb . 
What are you staring at ? 
Hanson said his cellphone is still transmitting from somewhere around here . 
Never actually written a song for someone before . 
It feels like I just pissed on one . 
She 's cute . 
- What happened ? 
You mess with me , you 're a dead man . 
And missing . 
It is for me . 
When did you get here ? 
You don 't cuddle people when they 're having a fit , do you ? 
- He 's in control . 
Gus , what are you doing here ? 
They 're as well armed as you with the same experience of debauchery . 
- Not anymore , thank God . 
Me too . 
Sorry . 
What 's that ? 
Now go over there and sit ! 
I 'm authorized to protect you ... 
Take a wild guess . 
I 'm not getting it , friend .

What is that supposed to mean ? 
I 'M NOT GOING BACK BEHIND THAT WALL . 
She in liver failure now . 
Which of these things belong to you already ? 
You must be Lt. Gannon .

He ended the relationship . 
That , and a lonely child hidden in a well by her mother . 
What 's up , kitty ? 
Master arm on . 
He said that he 'd found something , although he wouldn 't say what . 
Even with all that gear on your shoulder , you won 't last a night . 
Not with reason , but with yourself . 
Go , go , go . 
He lives in Brooklyn , she in Murray Hill . 
Have you always lived here ? 
Do you have to go ? 
In my case , they had something on me , 
I 've noticed your aliases are usually the names of popular musicians . 
Because they 're out there , Ollie , and I 'm in here . 
I found it ! 
Hodgins and Clark are trying to clean the bones now . 
Holy shit . 
Then I 'm relieved . 
What do we got ? 
- What are you doing ? 
Bad things happen here when you ask questions .

We 're not on a schedule , Alma . 
Last one finally knew a name . 
'Cause everyone is sleeping . 
She was a model . 
With the exact confirmation . 
I was just a baby . 
Maybe a bus driver could tell us . 
I swear to you 
Who 's there ? 
And when it gets here , I 'll give you a call , you come pick it up . 
A maiden running from a prince ?

Who raised you ? 
You are made of iron . 
- Come and have a dance . 
Since when ? 
This just ain 't me . 
- Well , aren 't you the sweetest thing ? 
Uh , well , this is a surprise . 
Nope . 
Is she glad that you brought Red John back into her life ? 
Frankly , it 's damn near impossible to do anything as a gay man . 
I will if you continue with your infernal questioning ... 
Adaline Bowman . 
What 's your earliest memory ? 
I took out a bit of a-a life insurance policy , Ben . 
- I 'm not this person you seem to think I am . 
Do you want to know ? 
It won 't end well . 
You don 't think I 'd do it , do you ? 
" Lobster à Ia Tudeski " ? 
And of course you know Lysette . 
Toxic somehow , a poisonous man . 
I made sure of that .

Or whatever and , like ... 
Gone for good . 
Previously on Damages 
Don 't we ? 
TTO 11 seconds , taken close .

Go home ... 
Claire has helped arrange a peaceful surrender . 
Did something happen between you and Erica Flynn ? 
Uh , stepmother-in-law ,

You got a problem with that ? 
Take good care of Mom . 
The mongoose I want under the house when the snakes slither by . 
I 'll miss you , you know ? 
We just lost cherno , sir . 
I took a m-missing juvenile report . 
That 's good . 
I 'm gonna run to the bathroom . 
Turn in your firearms , you mean ? 
Let 's go . 
I 'll see you back there . 
What have you to do with it ? 
She wants to know what we have . 
He looks pretty in control to me . 
Yeah , I 've been shaking up the wardrobe lately . 
Well , I have my whistle . 
This is now a double-rax , at least . 
( Doc ) Yeah . 
Thank you . 
Sorry . 
You know , the crows will get them . 
He might have shown it to me . 
I appreciate you bringing this to my attention , Flash . 
I can 't believe them . 
Don 't go . 
- I know . 
- Where ? 
You know what I mean ? 
I 'm scared . 
And , of course , nervous and excited . 
Trust me . 
Well , it 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
It occurred to me that the weather in Belgium is terrible at this time of year .

Keep the drone in pursuit of her . 
- Billy , who ? 
I am not assisting Dr. Brennan . 
We 're having a baby . 
I 'd stop right there . 
No , not that one . 
And what if someone gets violent inside this box , huh ? 
You know how chill zook is . 
You think he 's cute ? 
First of all , he 's not gonna do eight years . 
It 's out of our hands . 
I had the abortion . 
- I was screwed either way , so I went with the choice that helped someone . 
She never left . 
I don 't suppose any of you know how to pilot a submarine . 
My father was serious about this other woman so he divorced his wife .

It is a miracle . 
- No , you 're not . 
Are you ready to move on from your past ? 
How did Marcel get so bloody powerful anyway ? 
No , that would be Hanaoka . 
It is personal . 
Who could take these frisky little snow clowns ... 
Please , sit . 
You 're like an owl watching a mouse . 
I heard you clowned Kevin pretty good . 
I had not noticed . 
Don 't-don 't-don 'T . 
I didn 't know what it was . 
What can I grant you , in return ? 
You know what Hoppy told me ? 
Frankly I 've had about all the zombie apocalypse I can take . 
We have ... 
What 's wrong with you ? 
I got to go . 
You 're gonna pay for what you did to me .

Is that a rape whistle ? 
Dimitriu ? 
Let me ask you a question . 
You know what ? 
That 's very sweet , Andre . 
At least you knew Amin before you married him . 
That was you , wasn 't it ? 
Why would somebody have a box of clowns ? 
I tied the door shut . 
And that 's all you 're ever gonna be .

This isn 't on you . 
If you joke about it , I 'll rip your tongue out . 
- Four hours . 
- Mr. Russell - - 
Human heads , they leave . 
Oh , and I want to update my Facebook status . 
I told you , Dave . 
We 'll go to your hotel .

As long as the sun continues to rise . 
Isn 't anyone at this reunion who they say they are ? 
¶ ¶ Stuck in the same place I 've always been . ¶ ¶ 
Because I know Flynn , all right ? 
Most people think the hottespart of the flame is the white part . 
[ Rapid footsteps approach , depart ]

What was he doing outside the embassy that day ? 
Time to go . 
What else did patty say ? 
We wish that was the future . 
Yeah , I stayed up all night . 
By invitation . 
Your bag ... 
- It 's for you . 
I know it 's asking a lot , but 
But then this ... 
You had a run-in with the commissioner , yesterday ? 
But he 's headed for the White House now . 
- What is this ! 
Correct . 
I already took care of that , thank you . 
What do you say ? 
We 'll try this some other time . 
Why ? 
It 's inside of you . 
Listen , Finch , 
We need to talk to whoever saw Hanna last . 
- Pulp it . 
- Hang him ! 
Come here . 
Like some kind of relief valve or something . 
Never knew what she saw in you , really . 
Make something of yourself ! 
Trust me on this . 
You belong in the safety of the palace . 
See you in a few , Commander . 
I 've been following the news all day . 
Commander Denniston , Royal Navy . 
Something rather pressing . 
You know that 's a myth , right ? 
No , that 's just an exaggeration . 
I cared deeply about Natalie . 
Hold on ! 
No one suspicious . 
Look , the chocolate on your donut is melting . 
You don 't know me . 
We create and perceive our world simultaneously . 
- Is that your real name ? 
Sources are protected . 
Urghhh . 
It 'll come to you , sir . 
Yeah , he is . 
It 's not your time . 
But let me say ... 
Believe me ? 
Well , he claims someone attached it to him . 
No more secrets . 
Gave him a choice . 
He called me last night after I got home . 
- Put your hands up . 
- Way too high . 
You know , I 'm sorry that that all spilled out . 
Without someone up here , the Fifth Column doesn 't stand a chance . 
Can 't you see I 'm busy ? 
So you are not his sister , then ? 
Of course . 
We 'll know more in a few minutes . 
You know , legally she is an adult . 
- Yeah , we became very close . 
And of course the pressure of the boards on his back may have prevented gravitational loss . 
Just get out . 
- or them to be . 
Suddenly I 'm afraid . 
- I.D.S. Now , you wanna tell us 
I see lots of blood , but no bullet holes . 
But only if you 're ready . 
A little trick I picked up from the Colombians . 
Firm ... 
Your lucky day . 
Can you beam someone down ?

We got too much riding ' on this thing to leave to chance . 
My quarrel is with all of you . 
SHIP TO KENYA WILDLIFE PRESERVE AFRICA . 
I 'm sorry . 
And you , Beatrice . 
Then where do the stories come from , l wonder ? 
The rain is falling on my face . 
Deputies will be all over us . 
Don 't hang up the phone , please . 
- Who are you ? 
On the floor . 
Erica Brand , deserves better . 
You 'll be safe there . 
To close the books on your bar fight ! 
That 's all . 
We 're islanders , baby brother . 
I never mentioned your pregnancy . 
Houston , update . 
We 've got you , bastard ! 
Put that drive back in . 
How did you find that out ? 
If you insist . 
I ... 
Well we 've seen Amish zombies , Mormon zombies . 
We just got a call from old man Miller . 
I wasn 't about to get jacked up . 
Are you good ? 
I 'll call you when I land . 
How 's my boy ? 
Uh ... 
I 'm Mindy 's friend , Carmen . 
Burned at the stake . 
Wait ! 
That bothers you , doesn 't it ? 
Sounds like good advice . 
There are too many of them for every one of us . 
Who are you ? 
I never forgot it . 
She was blind in one eye . 
It 's not good to get summoned . 
Well , that 's true . 
You were weak . 
Look at us ... both producing news for television . 
Right now , I have to get in and get out . 
And then you planted the gun on Ivan knowing it would come out eventually that he was Elliot 's unstable ex . 
I would like you to stay . 
- What are you doing here ? 
I might miss this time . 
You 're not better . 
I refused , so it overheated a non-essential server . 
That dinner , that was a bit later . 
I was dancing the White Swan . 
See the zoo . 
Were you able to locate Fusco ? 
I 'm Patrick . 
Now 's the time for patience . 
- I didn 't tell you to fucking cut her open ! 
Besides , i 'm not really a party person . 
Crocodiles , poisonous darts , your sense of shame ? 
- Like Olympians . 
- Danny . 
Alexander doesn 't know what he 's talking about . 
How are you feeling ? 
- You got what you came for . 
Does that sound good ? 
For starters , it does help when you know the person . 
- What do you know about warfare ? 
- But it 's a whole ' nother year . 
May did . 
- Mama . 
Me , I did . 
Oh , God ! 
Dr. Arden , you still see me as microcephalic . 
Oh , I 'm scared of nothing because I love you . 
Everybody 's doing it . 
What the heck ? 
Papa , your foot right there . 
Let me go , and I 'll think about it . 
Our bad guy 's a good businessman . 
But he was a terrible man . 
You 'll look generous . 
I don 't care what you think . 
That 's that ? 
- You were out of line . 
What were you doing in the dungeons ? 
- Where 's the plane crash at Foothill ? 
I didn 't know you were a baseball fan , Finch . 
Colonel . 
You know , having wealth is nothing to be ashamed of . 
I 'm aware . 
- 8 to 1 , you forgot me . 
Gee , they 're scared . 
That 's not enough . 
You 're having a nervous breakdown , Lindsay . 
You 're not a mistake . 
Is that your building ? 
Yeah , you 're right . 
These borders are well-protected . 
So , I have a match for the puncture wound you found in the rib . 
That 's when we get him . 
After the brothers went to sleep , 
Now you can make those tight turns . 
No , perfect . 
I really like you 
Thank you so much for coming . 
- Nathan Glass . 
It 's good when everyone is older and wiser . 
Yes , ma 'am . 
I 'll call Animal Control . 
Yeah , I got a bone to pick with that bitch . 
You guys okay ? 
Are you the selkie ? 
You risked everything to save your friend . 
I 'm telling you all sorts of good stuff . 
Let 's go . 
Politics serves itself . 
I got pictures . 
I hate to interrupt but glamour is not permitted . 
I 've got to go . 
Of what ? 
A unique purpose . 
- What ? 
You can 't tell anyone . 
Give me some light . 
Why did he leave them exposed ? 
The girl in the red dress kissing you at the fountain ? 
I thought you said it was a kid 's game . 
- What about it ? 
All right , so we know how he tracked ' em , 
Is that the Declan case ? 
Are those girls ? 
Oh , man ! 
You 're not Western Union . 
Just ignore them , just ignore them . 
On the drive was a list of everyone he was working with in the government . 
Just ... you 're not one of them . 
Soon all the trees in the world will fall . 
All I want is you , dear . 
Thank you , ma 'am . 
It doesn 't work like that . 
He kicked butt , named names and made a lot of enemies . 
- What about you ? 
How much do you want ? 
Would you call Self and check on that ambulance ? 
You get the general ! 
- You win , counselor . 
Chinese ? 
Your father was a good man . 
I only told Cassandra about it . 
This is fun . 
- Now , see here ... 
That 's the only thing on the chip taken from his chest ? 
What do you say we get a hotel suite downtown to discuss this more in private ? 
Honestly ? 
I mean , that 's what John Gotti did to Paul Castellano in ' 85 . 
Good choice . 
The same thing that 's gonna happen to me . 
What the fuck do you want from me ? 
Brody takes him out ? 
We 're hiding . 
If you sneeze , the Ministry will know who wipes your nose . 
I love you too , pumpkin . 
- Don 't move . 
I 'll arrange to have it shipped to a safe location . 
What did he say exactly ? 
I always hated dentists . 
Nice and easy , 
Sit down and buckle up . 
So they sent someone we 'd trust to spy on us . 
No , of course not . 
Mom wants to party . 
I think SanCorp is missing out , not having a significant presence in Philadelphia . 
Where ... ? 
What is it , Navarro ? 
The Perry boys . 
Dale 's dead ? 
What does that mean ? 
It won 't come to a fight . 
If we get ten miles a gallon 
I have . 
Relax ! 
How would I know ? 
You 're a cop . 
I thought they were fairy tales 
It 's your responsibility now . 
Believe me , no one is more shocked than I am . 
Get in ! 
That 'll sober you up . 
I 'm still here . 
One scratch and we 're done . 
That 's why I 'm here , Rosalind . 
An era that will witness the advent of a human-centric consciousness ... that will place our world before all others . 
I was The Agency 's point person on Nazir . 
Sweets , you okay ? 
When does my vote outweigh yours ? 
This might come as a surprise , but people aren 't always honest . 
- I 've got it . 
Terrible at what ? 
Fat . 
And Jeb hasn 't been seen since he left the hospital . 
They may have killed Yoli . 
- Hey , you mind if I pound on that , Joe ? 
This is what I 'm talkin ' about ! 
Where did you get to ? 
To poison him ? 
I don 't mean to alarm you , but I think you may have a mold problem . 
Ask me . 
Patricia , this is Agent Olivia Dunham and Peter bishop . 
What ... what 's over there ? 
Autobots at this location . 
No , I don 't think I have . 
Let 's get out of here . 
You trim down like a sonofabitch and fat disappears . 
Those ripples . 
Schmidt , come on ! 
- Frank Semyon . 
Only you never told me that kid would wind up in the hospital . 
I feel bad . 
Just doing their end of the bargain . 
She killed Miles Dyson . 
Seems he had a PC with him . 
No . 
The one commonly referred to as HR . 
- Sarah . 
It 's from the elevator down the hall . 
Flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue and should be on the ground shortly . 
Pay the what ? 
Oh , my God . 
- This is insane , Sarah . 
- We , we didn 't see any signs . 
- How 's she doing ? 
Come on . 
A body . 
It was the old ones , wasn 't it ? 
I ... 
Who 's Mummy ? 
How 's school ? 
Seems like something that might be to our advantage . 
And of course I have to mention the elephant in the room ... 
People are gettin ' sick , they get sick and they get violent . 
I mean , it 's like the target 's trying to make his pattern look completely random . 
Sir ? 
The bomb has been deactivated . 
No fucking snoozing , boys , yeah ? 
Actually that 's--that 's where we met . 
Sister ... 
Kate austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other peoples ' lives after a plane crash 
You 're loving it . 
What are you saying ? 
I 'd take it myself if it wouldn 't cause so much collateral damage . 
Relax , old man . 
Look at all the detail . 
- l 'm sitting right here , come on ! 
In the woods . 
I 'll be stopping by your house tonight ... 
Your helmet 
Oh , and a hard tackle from Taylor . 
Oh , that must be hard . 
mr. Taylor , I understand you were looking for me . 
So kill me , but I still don 't know . 
How long does it take you to paint a square ? 
You know the key to surviving ? 
- Holy God . 
I 'm not sure I haven 't . 
We 're not . 
You can 't be talking to this man . 
This transport will take you there . 
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning . 8 : 00 a.m. 
No , you don 't worry me . 
How can they be when you so dominantly claim that title yourself ? 
Oh , that 's good . 
There 's a great mistrust ever since your company perished . 
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement . 
He saved my life . 
I may need you to take samples from the motel room . 
I have to get out of this wheelhouse . 
She 's here . 
Good evening , Good night . 
We arrest him outside . 
Of course it 's fifty grand . 
All right there , stiff ? 
That June Dad died ? 
I 'm wearing my entire wardrobe . 
Why , are we in danger ? 
- Ugh , Fitz ! 
It 's a Russian model calling me . 
On every ship around the globe . 
~ Why ? 
Pretty speech . 
No . 
I was Stayed there . 
What reasons ? 
The Second Commandment tells us , 
- Yeah ! 
You can 't even kill yourself to get away from him . 
- No . 
I 'm right here . 
How 'd you get in this time ... crawling through the basement like a rat ? 
Are you getting in or what ? 
We are all very excited to be here today . 
The Lodger . 
Okay ? 
Under anesthesia for liver transplant 
The court martial is piling up sentences . 
Oral morphine for my back . 
You have only one choice . 
- Knock knock . 
Happiness must be taken . 
Raymond , what have you done ? 
Now , you make the pain face , right ? 
I 'm still a little fuzzy . 
For getting you involved with Hanaoka over my petty quarrel . 
I wish you 'd stop being so damn stupid .

What are you talking about ? 
Very nice . 
" Possibly " means we might , we might not .

Yes ? 
Where you at ? 
Can 't go ten minutes without hearing another gunshot .

What you talking about , you 're from Huddersfield . 
Then you could 've met my boyfriend .

Are you hit ? 
You 're gonna have to give me your friend 's number . 
If they were still among us , they would be very proud .

He wants no part of what happens next . 
I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him . 
Now or for the foreseeable future . 
Mom went a little off the rails . 
Three days later she got hit by a car .

I 'm just gonna get some air . 
Why not ? 
Hello , yes ?

Put the heart monitor on the guard so no one knew Gideon was missing , at least as long as it took for the guard to die , which wasn 't long . 
What did you do to her ? 
Do you mind ? 
And I knew what he was going to do . 
Throw those ideas out of you head , you hear ? 
No wonder we keep losing people to civilian life . 
This is ridiculous . 
I was just starting to feel my character .

Mostly I poured wine . 
What about him ? 
What about Chucky ? 
But please ask Agent Dunham to bring the body- -

- Listen to me . 
Ex-cons , fugitives , drifters ,

She fought back and won . 
Ambrose Baylor , yes . 
We checked .

So I untied him , and he gives me this look . 
So , hell yeah . 
Look , it smells like smoke inside . 
However , due to the media frenzy surrounding the trial , 
- Put the bag over there and move over . 
So shut your mouth . 
That kind of bravery is never a failure . 
It isn 't healthy for you .

FINN : ( LAUGHING ) 
Did the convincing comrade teach you how to write a report ? 
You monster . 
I know , you never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am . 
According to Detective Carter , 
Yeah , we 're gonna need to get a look at Leona 's office . 
Which is why I had it laundered . 
I 'm kidding . 
I work for Starfleet Intelligence . 
And they don 't include you and your friends . 
No blame . 
- You 're going to learn to obey me . 
- Doc , am I dying ? 
I 'm not a doctor , Junior . 
Ok . 
She is no longer your sister . 
Wow , that 's a big step , Alan . 
I paid it so that I could profit from your death . 
It 's you who made me sad . 
Lazy ass ! 
Find me evidence of a money transfer . 
I heard a rumor Mr. Bowman had a bit of a temper . 
Aunty Claire doesn 't want to talk to us anymore . 
You want answers out of me , you have to earn them . 
He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon . 
- No . 
And you should be . 
What you said in the desert . 
I 'd be very grateful for some food . 
Course you wouldn 't . 
But you may be a little late . 
Sutton knows what ? 
Creek ends about six miles downstream in Watson . 
He 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing , hiding in plain sight . 
What happened back there ? 
Open the door ! 
I 'll be right back . 
I 've done a night jump into a drop zone under heavy fire , sir . 
I should have said no when the agency approached me . 
When exactly were you diagnosed ? 
At least he 's got me doing this . 
I 'm gonna be on you wherever you go . 
How the blazes did you get off that island ? 
What 's that ? " Why don 't you ask New York Teddy ? 
No more Mr. Nice Guy ! 
Look , just say what you want to say . 
Sam , engage manual override ! 
It 's much too rocky . 
What the hell ? 
You look tough . 
And neither do you , if you answer me wrong . 
Where 's the missing person 's report ? 
What would she have to gain ? 
Whoa , did you sleep in those clothes ? 
Where is he ? 
Hope you like tripe . 
What did your S.O. give you guys for morning drills ? 
You think this is why your grandmother tries to talk to you ? 
What an ugly little cork you are . 
I got that e-mail that Charles sent everyone . 
That this malvo character 
Why did you try and call the police ? 
Well , he couldn 't have known how bad it was gonna be . 
Don 't go all shaky on me . 
Children won 't listen 
Kay doesn 't buy the kind with sugar or caffeine but 
What do you see , Henry ? 
– Well I say : fuck that farmer . 
here 's the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd . 
Take a peek . 
You 're kidding . 
The mayor is very upset . 
Please , sit . 
He 's not your killer . 
And yet without it you 're dead . 
What are they doing now , practicing ? 
Still by the front door . 
It 's all right , sweetheart . 
You can 't win this . 
Welcome to the crew , Lionel . 
Go to your stations and good luck . 
- I tracked him to Paddington . 
Everything goes into escrow . 
But I 've got some good news for all of us . 
I won 't let anything happen to you ... 
We could hide . 
Agent Ray Caldwell , hostage rescue team leader . 
Say somethin ' . 
You gave Harris the double-shuffle . 
I don 't know what you mean ... 
- I 'll pick you up at the gallery ? 
" Self-help . " 
- We have to stop you bleeding . 
- I was asking him a question . 
I know , I came with people who were invited . 
Half a bottle of whisky a day , or is that a disqualification ? 
You 're the only person who can help us because , Desmond ... 
You 've been let go . 
He 's a freelancer of a different stripe . 
If you do , I 'll give you this . 
Relax , Richard . 
Now , we have no time to waste . 
Good . 
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods . 
So , that explains why Maddox killed Hauser . 
- Angelina . 
Drop the knife ! 
Lights out in five . 
What do you think , Finch ? 
Let 's go ! 
You know , it 's not sad . 
Hey , queer bait , where are you going with those bags , man ? 
- You can . 
Once we get rid of his friends , we 'll need him to lead us to the graves . 
Gave up the crankhead talking up the rape . 
So , Jason was hit with it . 
- Aye-aye , sir . 
You know , the last time somebody asked me that it was an accusation . 
Wake up ! 
I don 't know how those rumours started ! 
Why did he break the lock ? 
Could Decima want him dead ? 
By his side . 
Apparently , she had quite the secret inner life . 
I can 't have a nonbeliever tainting my flock . 
Science don 't know everything . 
# Oh , baby , don 't leave me ths way # #

Uh ... what should I say ?

Ready ? 
Put that down , boy .

Ask him if an angel can die .

You must be very proud of your projects . 
So he caught up with the schakal and of course , cut off his head . 
Now , let 's get this guy . 
Ar-Aren 't you Bob Harris ? 
But I couldn 't- - 
Oh , well ... 
Do you wanna go to the beach ? 
Okay , okay . 
If this is about Zed ... 
The trace was completed . 
So you walk him . 
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you . 
But you know what 's weird ? 
Well , there are no shadows , not anymore . 
Fine with me . 
.40 caliber . 
Have I threatened you before ? 
Families hacked and stacked in churches . 
What the hell are those ? 
I do this for all the boys after they 've been here for a month . 
You making some kind of statement ? 
Who are they ? 
We don 't use civilians as bait . 
He sucked out too much fat . 
They claim they 've been attacking their freighters . 
Great job getting rid of those cannons . 
We encourage creativity at the school . 
Being a little bitty boy and you been everywhere ? 
And the only way you 're gonna save their lives is if you man up and get on that boat . 
That 's it , get it . 
She nearly died . 
All right , if you say so . 
Who are you ? 
And then you just walked out . 
And this time , his daughter Micchan ... 
Sir , Murata-san 's here . 
- I can 't move my body . 
Not at all . 
Everything you need is already at Oscorp . 
- Come along where ? 
- Feel better ? 
Look , well , there is good farmland in the Gift . 
Holy fuck . 
Hey , sir . 
Do you ever think about cleaning your car ? 
Are you aware he was arrested ? 
There 's a warp signature encoded on this . 
I 'm trying to save them ! 
- It is not McClane , it is Gennero . 
Good , I 'm so glad . 
Some things happened ... 
Hey , Wayne ! 
Haddock 's treacherous first mate ? 
What do you want to see ? 
Break the trap , 
You 'll think of something . 
So , um , buckle up . 
Oh no , that 's too many balloons . 
Fluid in the lungs preventing oxygenation . 
Who is Sherlock Holmes ? 
- I made a mistake . 
Whoa . 
I didn 't know how . 
Yes , sir . 
Spread the word . 
What a coincidence . 
Well , keep your distance . 
- Spit it out . 
- Olivia . 
No , you won 't ! 
Have them lodge their passports here and report in every day . 
I hear it in your voice . 
4,000 . 
That 's the stuff ! 
¿ Eres un Chico malo ? 
Here it comes ! 
Plus I removed the bug . 
Eyes right . 
Which leads me to believe that he was " Yossarian , " 
Nice ride . 
Zach , the F.B.I. assures me this is an off-the-record chat . 
- Can you just not use my brush ? 
Call me back as soon as you 're on your own . 
What happens if I don 't cooperate ? 
I 'm sure we 'll be done quickly . 
These could use some water . 
You sound just like my ex . 
Would you do that just for me ? 
I 'm Chet Duncan , Bryce 's grandfather . 
Pick up whatever provisions we need . 
- Nice and tight , mate . 
I don 't know , maybe the time continuum won 't allow for it and one of you will be erased . 
Just my rock . 
Where 's Mrs. Boudreau ? 
I 've been thinking about Harrison . 
If you say so . 
Worry more about saving yourself . 
But if we lose eyes on this road , we could lose a lot more , Kyle . 
I kind of feel sorrier for the cut-in-half dude . 
I know what happens if you don 't look , and so do you . 
I 'm really sorry . 
Darling , it 's a relief to me to sit next to someone who isn 't deaf in one ear . 
Let 's never go back to the ' 20s ! 
I 'm not his date ! 
This is a real hearing presided over by a real judge . 
Ben , please . 
Agent Peterson ? 
What happened to your arm ? 
So how 's Lena ? 
I have to go . 
Kids at school say we 're really rich and that you give money to charity . 
This room is off ... 
You 're gonna have to excuse me a minute . 
I got to throw a flag on the play . 
First time he 's been on LAN . 
The game is still young . 
I don 't care about that bullshit . 
I found out what happened to Letty . 
I 'm about to burst ! 
You do remember what Charlie said about these people . 
- What am I about to put in my mouth ? 
Mmm , I don 't know . 
Bring this creature of yours . 
This shows the advanced stages of gangrene and epidermal rot . 
Uh , guys , you might want to see this . 
Anything for you , Carrie . 
Billy Hope ! 
- I 'm completely shut out . 
I 've been down to Base Camp and I 'm back to Camp 1 . 
Remember what he always called us ? 
You guys wash up for dinner . 
I went aftermarket on most of the parts here . 
She knows Timothy Carter wasn 't Red John . 
And it is my story for you now . 
I think they got all the peculiar they could stomach with these prints . 
Thoughts ? 
Described the John Doe as having dark hair . 
But he knows that the other seven ... are body doubles ... he has hired . 
I doubt it . 
It--it burns with a terrible cold , dark flame . 
I don 't give a shit about six years ago .

You think you can do that ? 
With what , Tommy ? 
So I assume you 've been giving some thought to formalizing our arrangement ? 
You know what ? 
Mr. Stiles , I 'm hoping you can help me with something . 
Not everything is as it seems . 
I love you . 
They 're identical to the ones on the map . 
See that new belt he 's wearing ? 
Umme Kalsum . 
That 's so sad . 
Remind me never to rub you the wrong way . 
You decided not to kill those people . 
Maybe a few terrible wrongs . 
And if they could prove it ... 
I thought we should celebrate . 
Very well . 
Uh , Carrie Mathison . 
When I gave up teaching to join the CIA , 
Oh , well , that 's funny , considering you just stole the ledger only a day ago . 
Never take your eye off your opponent . 
Hey , man , look , we 're not gonna hurt you .

Transplanted black market modified hearts . 
He was a vet . 
It 's highly unlikely it 's airborne . 
He 's gonna need to update that code , adjust it to the tablet . 
- No , I 'm not leaving . 
This is home . 
Who put the cameras in this place ? 
- Grab it ! 
Shoot it already ! 
Got a lot of good reasons not to trust Jim Rennie . 
Maybe next time . 
Let go of him ! 
I knew he was here , so ... 
You like ? 
No , they don 't know the place like I do . 
Regarding my capacity for niceness . 
I 'll wait for your instructions . 
It 's pretty bad . 
Walter , I am not following .

If it bites your arm off , you get disability for the rest of your life . 
He 's your cousin . 
Debra , it seems that you tried to kill Dexter as well as yourself . 
- We 've got regular days now . 
Do I think I will , what ? 
- Good .... 
It 's your turn . 
( laughs ) Me , too , man . 
I 'll party on my own . 
You seem more preoccupied than usual . 
I 've seen enough . 
Do it now .

Soong didn 't get off this ship without help . 
That 's what we 're working on . 
Go wait for me outside .

I heard from other people - - Abbott . 
We need each other to get to DC . 
- Yes . 
I see you still have a thing for blonds . 
Well clone , Bella .

It 's your breeding skin . 
And this can cause me a lot of problems . 
I want my daddy . 
What happened ? 
There 's nobody named Roy Tagliaferro in the database . 
I sent her after information . 
Not even time to show any of them mercy . 
Don ' t be a foolish boy . 
How much do we need ? 
Overtons killed Beltran 's little brother . 
The Turk . 
It is our only chance someone will find us . 
Just like-just like you don 't call Margo mommy , right ? 
Tell my sister where her room is first . 
It changes everything .

You know him better than anyone . 
And I need a place to think 
No .

I 'm not going anywhere , Mom . 
Did your men deactivate ... the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon ? 
You can 't believe how much food I 've been consuming .

Someone with tremendous means wants Caroline Turing gone . 
File on Porchetto Senior 's quite an interesting read .

Hey dude , how much money you got ? 
So even in death he got the better of you . 
My sister won 't allow it . 
Quit your hollerin ' and get yourself a goddamn Band-Aid . 
Rick killed him . 
Turn off the machines . 
I think he was gonna propose to her . 
You have skills that we want .

Say you forgive me ! 
A screwdriver , okay . 
One you don 't like telling people .

I never even had gumbo . 
You think he 's alone ? 
Who did Mr. Diggle talk to ? 
Hey , let me guess . 
You know , there 's a major buzz waiting ' for you inside that meat . 
Super glue on his finger tips .

Seems she 's thinking about getting married to this guy she 's living with . 
- This boat is dead . 
I think they 're searching people . 
And what 's so special about this Claire ? 
Whoa , whoa , whoa . 
Junior high , bigger school . 
It appeared to be a glitch , happens all the time . 
Covered wrists ? 
I don 't particularly enjoy it , either . 
Why you talking like you have a choice ? 
Because it 's really not your style , Rogers . 
His badge number begins with a zero , 
They say what killed the guy ? 
I 'm not one of them .

What for ? 
If we fail to repay these loans , the bank will fund our enemies . 
There are some serious unanswered questions . 
Um , just blood cells . 
Putting them together . 
Frank , why you working for these fucking Russians ? 
Tell me . 
- Why am I the bad guy here ? 
And judging from the lividity and pooling on the right side of her face and torso , 
And the girth ! 
Uh , okay . 
We 're not getting on so well , that 's the problem . 
Impossible . 
She deserves to move to her next life . 
All right . 
Brother Sam doesn 't know you like brother Brian does . 
I believe in lots of things . 
We 're staring right at it , McGee . 
( screaming ) Mommy ! 
She 's asking for the rest of it . 
Go ahead . 
You 're him . 
Come here . 
I 'm not sure I want to sell . 
The most important thing we can do is make her feel as comfortable as possible . 
Oh , I like that . 
September 19 . 
Tobey Marshall versus Dino Brewster . 
At least have the balls to pull the trigger yourself . 
Raul Lopez . 
It appears we have lost our burglar . 
Looks like it . 
I think you better talk to somebody about this . 
No , but I 'd like the whole report . 
Just make her a nice zoo screen saver and she 'll be just as happy . 
Who 's coming ? 
Thank you boob lady ! 
As you can see , the famous New Year 's Eve ball , which is displayed year round , is not in place . 
Just when I try to get out , they pull me back in . 
What is this ? 
Sean Fentress ? 
I 'm sorry . 
Yeah I was pretty clear on that . 
Enough ! 
I want to save our people . 
- ... to be brave enough to tell him so . 
You look like you 're hurt , for certain . 
I 've lost satellite , and I 'm trying to get it ba ... 
They 'll just have to make the best case they can . 
Or what happened to them . 
Right here , fellas . 
The one and only . 
They won 't take you out . 
Irwin ! 
Only way you can film anything in California now . 
I think he might be the monarch . 
That 's kind of creepy , don 't you think ? 
It seems that all of us , the senator included , were fooled by him . 
She was not the only one who wished to get through . 
tomorrow we figure out what the hell we 've stumbled into . 
Can you just stop ? 
He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn 't called back yet . 
You know ? 
You promised . 
Then the Tet sent troop ships down . 
One dissident against rome ? 
Take him ! 
That 's just what he thinks . 
I don 't know why he has it . 
The night at the diner ? 
Ritter . 
I 'll look for you . 
I can explain . 
This old town can slow you down 
Soon as the ring went on her finger . 
Oh , it won 't balance the sleigh . 
Never brought a girl home before ? 
Where 's Aayan ? 
Single stab wound to the heart . 
I had it all , tv shows , women too . 
He did the same with me last week . 
You had to tip her $ 500 just to have a drink with you . 
I need to know his death had meaning . 
It must be open season on the fbi . 
That 's impossible . 
It 's ill-advised . 
Joshua was our most important ally on the ship . 
You make it impossible to care . 
I say we take some of these and go and have a look around outside . 
What are you praying for ? 
You said this girl killed people . 
- Oh ... 
I need your guys ' help . 
He wouldn 't hurt a fly . 
Yes , I have . 
- Oh , Tony ! 
- Get out of my way , kid . 
Look , if I don 't find it , he 'll go and get one from somebody , so I might as well do it . 
Give him the gun . 
100 men , one woman . 
I 'm convinced that Russians must either die or win . 
Insane , really . 
In the back ! 
Get ready to jump , Sven ! 
I know because I built it . 
If I leave now , I can still make it . 
You have been in an accident . 
Nothing 's more important than your health . 
Look across those fields , brother . 
- Mantis , this isn 't about you . 
" Heavy lies the crown " sort of thing . 
And the owl is Eva , intelligence and analysis . 
And where did you two meet ? 
Are you telling me you seriously think one man could do all this ? 
I need to find her , too . 
Now if Vicki calls , tell her to wait for me , okay ? 
That 's creepy . 
I forgave him . 
They 'll never have met anyone like you . 
Why Missy ? 
- Ready . 
I told you things were gonna get interesting . 
- What happened ? 
Look , Dexter , you 're an offensive lineman . 
We don 't think it looked like that by the time you got there ; 
Get yourselves inside ! 
Charmer . 
Where 'd you get a cigarette ? 
I-I ca ... 
And then I got yanked out . 
Well ... anything for a break from exams . 
Well , you haven 't told me what it is yet . 
I should get a medal for what I did to him . 
That 's a long story . 
And guard your property ? 
But I do not know much about you . 
Oh , come on you guys . 
We 'll continue when I return . 
I send you to be invisible . 
Yes , you may touch the floor . 
Except they say it 's got a human face sometimes , and then at night they say it ... 
The only map left in existence ... is the one that 's in my head ... 
I am worried . 
Mmm , what ? 
How ya feelin ' ? 
Well , Dan , it is now . 
He was treated at Community Hospital in Beaverton . 
You wanted your brother . 
- How did you learn computer science without committing yourself to it ? 
If you need anything , I 'll be in my office . 
- Let 's not ... 
Don 't do anything reckless . 
I never thought you 'd pick him . 
THIS TIME , I DO NEED TO GO . 
Working on a cold case . 
Then I used your voice-spoofing tech , which you 've already got , and boom . 
The grouping on hunt 's chest was tight . 
It doesn 't matter who I am for me , either . 
You ... you gonna pop me ? 
By leaving her with your sister 's murderer ? 
- They live in fear . 
Business is business . 
Anyone else who wants to come , now is your last chance . 
Previously on Elementary ... 
But ... 
The Duchess of Bay Ridge . 
I need to talk to you . 
How come the CIA has never discovered any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate . 
My goose is cooked . 
I very much respect the sacrifices you men make . 
- You calm down , it 's my house ! 
You lived in new york at the time . 
We know nothin ' of her , Massa . 
So did God tell you about the demons ? 
That 's a lot of inventory to check . 
I always lose . 
Oh yeah , you thought it was a premeditated hit . 
You knew she was leaving , didn 't you ? 
- No , I just have a quick question . 
No mercy in life . 
He 'll stab us in the back first chance he gets . 
I have things on my mind . 
There could also be one 77-year-old virgins . 
- I love you . 
- Although I could go for a double vodka rocks right about now . 
- Where 's the owner ? 
I should warn you , 
" Run , " he said . 
To reach the terminal , you 'll need to pass the main gates . 
Let me see . 
To which I 've said a definitive " no . " 
♪ I can see the secrets hanging ' round your neck ♪ 
I can walk through a plan in my mind , examining every beam and every rivet . 
You 're still tripping . 
Do you remember anything else , anything odd ? 
Well done , well done . 
This was before it was blue . 
You won 't find anything . 
Who ? 
He 's also married to Natalie Green , who 's pregnant . 
Todd 's new to the game . 
You must still be jet-lagged . 
You hold it like that , you just drop it down there like that . 
I know you have a conscience because you 're an inventor , like me . 
- No , here , have mine . 
You got that ? 
You never let Pycelle near you . 
And when the sun rises , I promise you , 
It 's your room . 
Here we go . 
Is he okay ? 
He wants the best on this one , he says . 
Let me take you home . 
I 'm a pirate . 
- Have three more for you . 
Slogans for $ 400 . 
- Morning , Mr. Twistle . 
Yeah , at first , then he got greedy . 
Here 's to you , Meep . 
Wherever could it be coming from ? 
See you 're moving on . 
But none of them had once fought for their own lives . 
I know what spiders are thinking . 
Why not ? 
I met a young man yesterday . 
Really going out on a limb there , Duck . 
I 've- - 
Yours . 
Forget it ! 
Easy , tydeus . 
You 're right , It 's not my fault . 
Organized brilliantly . 
And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized . 
You said yourself 
After the sky 
A thousand every round your bot survives . 
- Well , maybe . 
You mean like how you 're supposed to act on a first date ? 
That 's all . 
This is Warden Haskley . 
OK , Krueger . 
I 'll be right back . 
- Do somethin ' smart . 
That 's two things . 
So go to it . 
Of course he 'll release the video . 
Someday I 'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull . 
- I know they saved you , but ... 
And he can 't risk anyone discovering his condition . 
Those are the days that I miss . 
Just give me a second . 
Let 's just do the interview , right ? 
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is . 
It 's fucking unfair , that they get the same as us . 
- There 's a cruiser approaching at high speed on Baywood . 
Shaw must have pulled all the cops to him . 
Okay ? 
This is Broyles . 
Look at me . 
All this effort for this ? 
They cannot follow us . 
- You hate him ? 
" Read a book . " 
Where did you get this ? 
The boy will meet you there . 
Actually , could you close the door ? 
And after all the outrage , when I 'm ready ... 
There will be an informational meeting held in the LT-431 , right after school today . 
Over a thousand times a day just walking the streets . 
The friendship that we had is over . 
Oh , my ... 
Happy birthday ! 
I heard about your family . 
Solution was right under my nose , but I was paying attention to the wrong clues ? 
May sorted it out . 
I don 't think so at all . 
What about you ? 
- No . 
9 : 06 . 
- With Jack Crawford 's attention . 
He 's still willing to fight for a good cause . 
It 's not gonna happen , you fucking nut . 
That 's rude . 
And she knows what happened underneath it . 
My name is Christos Theophilus . 
And I 'm sure you 're more than familiar with their current financial problems . 
And nobody else with a gun knows where to aim it ? 
You can 't take credit for your work . 
We need to organize a rescue . 
Oh , that is beautiful work , Margaret . 
You seen Boden ? 
Thank you . 
I don 't ... 
It 's never going to stop . 
No , you told me this was for the greater good . 
You don 't believe that nonsense . 
Did you say goodbye ? 
What are contraptions ? 
He said it 's not for sale . 
I mean , the guy said she was still breathing . 
Uh , Santa Carla , in the Valley , but , uh , no . 
And scared . 
Open the door . 
All to make his wife 's death mean something . 
He came on to me . 
- Take it easy , doc . 
- Yes . 
My wife ... same thing . 
For God 's sake man this is untamed wilderness . 
When will they let you know ? 
360 aerial , baby ! 
Jaqen H 'ghar offered you three kills . 
No , she 's telling the truth . 
You are . 
- What ? 
Make all the arrangements . 
We have a unit on the way . 
All that ? 
This is what I do . 
I 'll be in the worst trouble ever . 
What really happened ? 
And then it got really awkward , because I didn 't know who he was . 
A simple moniker for a complicated monster . 
So what 's here ? 
Previously on Homeland ... 
Better . 
- Yes , I know . 
Had intercourse , sex . 
Go ahead . 
But it 's too late for that . 
Just your room number , DeJorio . 
Or why it came up here with you . 
You 'll win in eight moves . 
Execute my order . 
Stu , have a pen , yeah ? 
He was trained by the Russian mob as a teenager . 
I 'm all right . 
I was a very young man . 
More importantly , how do you want to be remembered ? 
The king of feeling nothing . 
Yeah , that 's right . 
A king . 
You here to fight with us ? 
You guys mock up a track . 
That 's why we can 't monitor it . 
Wake up . 
And then he suddenly appeared on the road . 
Hey , come on . 
Maybe you should ask one of your goons for it . 
- You shouldn 't have come here . 
They got 3-D coming out , like , any day now . 
It wasn 't what I could do for Bella , it was what I couldn 't do to you , Jack . 
Watch out , Alex ! 
Maybe I should go inside . 
How long does it take painting ? 
A squeaIer ? 
We were wrong . 
YOU CAN 'T BE SERIOUS . 
So , what are you up to ? 
Oh , I think the first four times of you in court was enough for me . 
What happened ? 
Stress testing the keypad . 
What are we gonna call it ? 
He 's a friend . 
That 's down to Mark . 
All right , Jenkins . 
He killed BIanche . 
What the fuck are you gonna do with my son ? 
Please sit down . 
My husband , too . 
I didn 't realize she was anyone 's girl . 
Oh , no ! 
Oh , thank you . 
Do you mean to say that she has a penchant for woodworkers ? 
Someone else is holding the rifle . 
That 's anecdotal hearsay . 
There 's someone on the phone . 
No one knows what you look like . 
Prudent course of action when vetting a potential candidate , yes . 
The dessert was ... 
And then I 'll say ... 
But he also stands for other things . 
Hey , we 're here at the Coliseum in Rome . 
Sit tight . 
Me , is greater . 
Hey , boss , Cho got a D.M.V. hit on the victim 's prints . 
- Smile , Monsignor . 
- Merci . 
Monte Carlo ? 
Now I 'm thinking that it is . 
I 've done some dumb things . 
I gotta go . 
Or let them turn it over to Samaritan ? 
Oh , kids , what did I tell you ? 
Tomorrow morning , when God permits 
Get it done before he gets back . 
I 'm sorry , I don 't wanna get off on the wrong foot , do I look in the patch or the eye ? 
If you remember your life ... then what happened on that night is going to come back to you . 
- Abandonment requires expectation . 
Take it easy , now . 
Logan , don 't you have a class to teach ? 
It 's all right . 
He hasn 't been told . 
Then help us find him . 
You have news ? 
That doesn 't mean I 'm wrong . 
Thank you . 
Hands where we can see them ! 
Is he okay ? 
Denizens of central city , 
They 're from the old days . 
There are 12 Olympian gods . 
I 'm just gonna check something downstairs . 
Take me to it . 
I think that man was you . 
He , uh , left a message . 
♪ I 've fallen for you 
We all remember that one , right ? 
Sonic projectors engaged . 
I 've finally realized that . 
You ain 't no gangster . 
Is completely ... 
I 'm not pretending . 
Um , not for a couple days , at least . 
King of the Andals and the First Men , 
Anywhere you want . 
You must be Dr. Burke . 
This room is going dark . 
I hear that , who 's fucking cheating ? 
Yeah , he was a low-level scumbag . 
It 's easier as you go down . 
You and I have got a date , remember ? 
What 's happening ? 
- Ask her . 
The dark matter must have combined with the bomb particulate inside your body . 
I 'm wondering why , if you needed $ 1,000 for an Internet venture , you didn 't ask my clients for it . 
And you memorized that instead of doing what ? 
Biologicals here . 
Looking good . 
Monday . 7 : 38 P.M. 
I 'm Dr. Sevard . 
I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head . 
What about everything else that could go wrong ? 
Masuka found a match on the print we had from the cigar butt . 
You still haven 't produced a single lead connecting Sergeant Brody to any plot against America . 
Would you please stop calling me that ? 
Get out of the house ? 
pod 197 ... we 're under attack . 
Still no sign of Khan . 
about the money ... 
Very difficult to get right . 
And as my first act with this new authority ... 
You cannot see what you have become . 
And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself . 
I 'd better not get caught . 
Men astride magnificent beasts . 
Out of thin air ? 
I don 't know any safe . 
Give me 20 minutes . 
You can kill him if you want , we have plenty of guards . 
I 've nothing to live for except for you . 
You shouldn 't be this deep in the forest alone . 
Shut up and stay away from me ! 
But why would I want to ? 
How he would send you against America . 
Really ? 
Taking a chunk of development along the rail corridor . 
Why 'd you come back , Knox ? 
Tomorrow , train ? 
They 've breached the shield ! 
So , what happened to you ? 
Help us ! 
That 's my cab . 
It is . 
Come on Tony , you should at least go see him . 
- Don 't touch my hair . 
You 're a talker . 
Come on . 
We have to finish restoring Wild Geese Gate in 15 days . 
Now , I 'm not some New York socialite ... 
Why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever use ? 
They 'd rather burn than fight for me , so be it . 
I get a call from you to come over to your house and pick up Alicia . 
I 'm Bruce Wayne . 
They will let us go any day now . 
( off screen ) I 'm going in ! 
( Male voice ) I for one have had enough of this guy 
Let 's watch it on the radio . 
Just me and this no-name world . 
My microbot ? 
Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish . 
Propose . 
Where 's my phone ? 
My wife , she 's a good dancer , isn 't she Bigelow ? 
Can I trust this guy ? 
- Everything is under control . 
That 's what I would like to believe , yeah . 
Scott , you all right ? 
I did what I felt I had to do to protect our species . 
Isn 't that a beautiful way to go out ? 
If I think I 'm being followed , I walk out with the bag over my right shoulder . 
You 're gonna kill yourself ! 
- What 's getting worse ? 
Let me see . 
No way he 's dirty . 
No , what about the Pattersons ? 
I felt we 'd already been down that road . 
Now you know . 
John was right . 
- You coming ? 
You could have really hurt them . 
Would that do ? 
Now , get to work . 
And then ? 
You gotta try . 
- Can she handle herself ? 
Jesus Christ ! 
James , wait . 
You 're no longer in charge . 
And go get your groove back . 
Raul who ? 
I 'm saying , you want to work ? 
You be nice . 
This is world-class . 
Come to think of it , Evan doesn 't even have any fucking nieces . 
I know . 
Is something funny ? 
Oh , Angela 's right . 
Yeah , I 'll be right there , girls . 
Are you sure we can 't get O 'Brien 's public defender ... 
You stupid twat . 
Let 's move . 
What 's wrong ? 
We let mornings and evenings go by , and waited . 
You need to use your instinct . 
I think so ! 
Who is it ? 
Drop your weapons . 
Besides , 
Does Mom know ? 
Tessa , promise me you 'll always use a condom . 
This is an emergency evacuation . 
( CLEARER ) Mum ! 
- I 'm sorry . 
Well I guess we ate it , then . 
Good for me , bad for his gums . 
It would be a flagrant violation of HIPAA guidelines . 
You knew all of it . 
That 's great , Barry . 
That 's gonna have to do . 
I guess I should have paid more attention . 
You 're my brother . 
Looks like I 'm gonna have to go away for a while , y 'all . 
- We 're talking about you . 
Keep it up . 
- I mean , he 's just a guy , right ? 
Think of who you are . 
All right , meet me at the 7th Avenue entrance . 
I can 't enjoy my sesame chicken because of it . 
It can 't be a coincidence . 
Again . 
- Harold , I- - 
Well ask the ' Information ' about what to do in this situation . 
Go , go ! 
He teaches John Henry stuff . 
So have at it . 
I can make him stop . 
- Looks like mostly retail and restaurants . 
We need you to move , partner ! 
My spies whisper but cannot substantiate . 
We 'll hit something in the road . 
Bullshit ! 
And Vicki ... 
- Is he coming back ? 
Inside . 
- I understand completely , sir . 
Yeah , the residue test didn 't turn up nothing . 
Had to be sure . 
I don 't understand . 
- You 're sorry ? 
Mrs. Queen , how does it feel to get away with murder ? 
Are you still in Tahiti ? 
Be advised we have structural collapse inside . 
He wouldn 't let anyone see it . 
Were you even listening ? 
- Hi . 
Sadly , Elizabeth uses it for the badminton equipment . 
Listen to me ! 
Did I keep you awake last night ? 
Then you seem just like everybody else . 
Cut it the day after Ella was born . 
You 're afraid . 
You 're a good friend . 
We get to start again in a new and better world . 
- No , no , no , no ! 
You certainly did . 
- Nathan , please . 
Where did ... ? 
Our enemies have " gun " guns . 
I understand you 're the genius who persuaded Alec to destroy ARC . 
A terrible event and the church piles in gleefully . 
Are you kidding ? 
I 'm v- - 
I 'm his coach . 
And that I wish I could have been there . 
The water cools the fever , yes ? 
I was surprised you accepted this transfer . 
- I 'm not going to kill you . 
- I 'm going back for her ! 
Where is daddy ? 
- It 's a cool ride , huh ? 
Let 's get serious . 
I can turn him back . 
I 'm gonna have somebody call her . 
Dr. Feelgood 's got it . 
I 'll cast a little spell for you . 
But she could get that at any pharmacy . 
Not interested . 
He killed my mother , Jim . 
Yes , Lord Tyranus . 
- Ya are a no-account bastard . 
- No , it 's ... 
Get down , everybody ! 
Forget it . 
Yeah , that 's right , baby . 
Not his lucky day , is it ? 
Look , I don 't fucking know , but I 'm not taking the fall for this . 
This beast thinks like a man . 
- I tell you , they couldn 't have done it ! 
Somebody pull me up . 
Rachel 's told me everything about you . 
Roger , Kilo-Bravo , be advised that Iraqi patrol is closing on your position . 
Let 's do it . 
Looks like Mrs. Drake 's hit man just found his target . 
You do realize the bar is set very high with me and pancakes . 
I 'm sure , dear . 
You heard me . 
What do you mean ? 
We all know that gang proliferation has been rising . 
You have men ? 
I told you , I can 't see shit out here . 
What kind of murder weapon leaves that on a body ? 
It 's a murder / kidnapping thing . 
Like this , maybe ? 
Extremely vague . 
I want to go home . 
What do you see ? 
If you haven 't gotten Phillips back by the time they arrive , the SEALs will take care of it .

I 'm positive . 
Charlie , do you copy ? 
I guess you showed them . 
What were you thinking ? 
My demands ? 
This started with the three of us . 
Listen , I know it 's awkward , and , uh , 
All right , so how about we get , you know , down to it ? 
It 's just not the way the other side plays . 
Not enough . 
Nothing in here . 
Yeah , you doing all right ? 
After all this ? 
As dungeons go this one 's not so bad . 
I say " very good , " Dr. Wells . 
- Just locum work . 
Officer Stop ' n Go passed me . 
I 'm afraid John isn 't quite ready for our school . 
We 're 55 % of the way from Houston to Washington . 
- Because ? 
What are you doing later tonight ? 
Hey , it 's a little late for house calls , don 't you think ? 
We 've all wanted to shoot Daryl . 
It 's relevant to your testimony . 
How long you think you 've got ? 
Eddie , would you mind canvassing again ? 
You don 't believe the story of the Great Pumpkin ? 
And how many of our sons and brothers did we just ship home in body bags ? 
At some point , the thought would have occurred to you . 
A man has duties as well . 
Me , too . 
There are no men like me . 
Realtor says she can shome some apartments tonight . 
- I don 't know . 
- You guys are great together . 
I don 't understand it either . 
I never realized how far down I could go . 
I 've seen it . 
You 're stronger together . 
Let 's go . 
What 's your name ? 
Bruising to the neck and windpipe and at the top of the spine . 
Two miss teen temecula county titles . 
I should thank you , Dr. Brennan . 
" You let me down , Onslow , 
Exactly what do you want ? 
Magnetometer is picking up a hell of a lot of anolies down here . 
Someone else was here , and they took her case . 
I gave you the toughest nut of the bunch . 
- Don 't leave me , please ! 
I just wanted to give you a heads up , so it doesn 't catch you off guard . 
Congratulations . 
My little gambit didn 't work . 
No , more like teeth and claw marks . 
So , yesterday you said that I was getting ahead of myself . 
Shake that ass . 
You 've never asked me about your mother . 
The streets will be cleared so let 's go . 
I was really trembling . 
Jerry Shaw , go to the touchscreen . 
The feet ! 
CREW HAD REASON TO THINK ME DEAD NOT THEIR FAULT 
Tough titties . 
Alice , sweetheart , it 's not that bad . 
Actually , I think I have seen her . 
Long-established covens were torn apart . 
There 's no way of knowing what he 's capable of . 
But I could see it . 
- It 's odd , though . 
- Where were you ? 
I like the way you explain things . 
- Okay . 
- These are beautiful . 
- Good night , Jim . 
This is delicious . 
You 're not half as smart as you think you are . 
- Cheers . 
What things ? 
Wilson and Fisher ? 
I can 't find Mom , so I need your help . 
Can 't top it ! 
We have T minus 2 min 10 sec to launch , by the mark . 
That 's not yours ? 
Holy shi ... ! 
Yeah , I remember him .

Can you get the ransom together in enough time ? 
It 's just a precautionary measure . 
It 's ringing . 
Someone 's happy . 
A lot of buy-and-busts , a lot of money hanging around . 
Thanks , but it 's a little too late for that . 
It takes every one of us to resist rhesus . 
Sounds like a perfect match . 
Sinners have been blinded while glancing upon the pages . 
You have been accepted . 
I wish you wouldn 't say that . 
How I made it work for so long . 
Isn 't Heck handsome ? 
Son of a bitch . 
Trained my entire life to master my senses . 
That is beautiful work . 
Come with me to Washington . 
But why did you lie about who you were ? 
My lord ... 
" dear mr. Jane , i do not like to be slandered in the media , 
It 's very rare . 
God , you guys are such goddamn pussies . 
It 'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it . 
After that , anything we want can be our cadaver . 
I have half a mind to enchant the locks after you leave .

There you go . 
Walk with me . 
Don 't even say my name . 
And there was no one I could talk to about it 
I wrote to you , Booth . 
- For breeding . 
He only regained consciousness this morning . 
Every single call she got , she took . 
With the security feed out , 
no , she is most thorough . 
- What ? 
You 're an asshole , Jake ! 
I got something coming for you , baby . 
You know , " What are you in for ? " Like that . 
Peter , I didn 't see anyone . 
That 's a neat trick . 
It 's fine . 
We 're all trapped here because of her . 
Then you shouldn 't need me to explain everything . 
I 'm not on any register . 
- Yes ... 
See if they take the word of an alien over mine . 
It hurts me to see the sadness in your eyes . 
When 'd you start dealing V ? 
It doesn 't Matt ... it doesn 't matter what he said . 
Good girl . 
The child can 't be dressed like that on her birthday . 
Here 's the thing , Cody . 
I never loved my brothers . 
It 's nice to meet you . 
Got back just in time to catch my flight .

But she still had to have an accomplice . 
Go to the beach house , tom . 
Is she all right ? 
What was the passcode ? 
The one who killed all those people over in Bemidji ?

I didn 't know what to say . 
- Charlie , what are you doing here ? 
Ronnie is gonna have a field day with this one . 
You don 't think I want change just like you do ? 
No cage , bottle or vessel can hold it . 
You say he hasn 't abandoned you , but , at the same time , you find yourself wandering around Wolf Trap in the middle of the night . 
What safe ? 
You work a lot of late nights , Mr. McGee . 
This ain 't Branson , Missouri , know what l 'm talking about ? 
First time I ever saw him uh , smile .

No , that 's where they want us - thinkin ' we got no chance . 
This thing you think killed Tamara , what 'd it look like ? 
This poisoner was the first .

It 's a 2-1 , and it sits directly on the beach . 
Wonder who that is . 
Here I am . 
Alec ! 
Go on . 
All right , we 're on our way .

The remains are in the pig troughs ? 
THAT IS DISAPPOINTING . 
Not with those glasses .

It 's like a damn romance novel . 
If you harm Detective Fusco ... 
A friend and I are just camping out on the floor .

I saw the vigilante ? 
You punish her . 
You didn 't think to notify us ?

I lost my job , claire . 
The world ain 't saving itself .

Lived with her mom outside town . 
But don 't go swimming in there . 
He 's my sister 's boyfriend .

Is that why you 've kept your distance ? 
Ask yourself why they picked you . 
Yes , Sir . 
I found this book . 
Her name 's Lola . 
Iona belongs to me ! 
Maybe in America , Irish . 
Was this the guy ? 
'Cause I 'm good .

But , there 's a limit to what we can do with him ? 
I 'm right here . 
I request my command be reinstated and your permission to go after him . 
This is the end . 
Dad , want to take a drive later and see the old homestead ? 
The restaurant is run by Bauerschwein .

In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown . 
Well , sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through . 
I hobbled them last night . 
Guess we 're taking the bus today .

Okay , R means go backwards and P means stop . 
I 'll be back . 
What are you doing here ? 
He 's the guy she did those webisodes with ... 
It doesn 't make any sense . 
I think Eddie 's trying to convince the Captain that The Flash is a public menace . 
There is the very bad storm again . 
You got lucky . 
Um , but - - 
I know what it 's like to lose the people you love . 
Here , boss . 
I just don 't trust Murphy , okay ? 
He can take care of Bauer at the same time . 
The truth is in the wind . 
My old man was off on a bender with some waitress . 
I 'll always think of you fondly .

To splice human and ape genes . 
And it 's gross and unappealing . 
Going to need you to come with me . 
At first , it appears to be the normal cotton fibres . 
From who ? 
No one knows where he is . 
Whatever you think of Petey , we either go with him or we got nothing . 
And that 's when he told me . 
See what I mean . 
Good morning . 
I carried that to the trash ! 
And not any time in the near future because I am done getting my hands dirty . 
Yes , oh , yes , let 's get that shirt off ! 
- Either of you guys want another drink ? 
Huh , I hear a lot going on in redevelopment . 
Maybe not . 
Yet all you want is the answer to one question ? 
- I feel sad . 
Now let 's see you take them apart . 
Now how do I get you out of here ? 
Run it . 
There 's too many . 
This is Simon Cruller , sir . 
But they 've saved my life dozens of times . 
Shh ! 
Ma 'am , are you still there ? 
What were they arguing about ? 
Do you hear the Voice ? 
No , wait ! 
You can be a coked-out , coked-out whore . 
The key to Miss Tomoko 's room . 
There are other ways of finding out what my son knows . 
Is that lieutenant Morgan in a skirt ? 
Does that mean I 'm an actor ? 
What do you say we meet ? 
Well , get confirmation . 
Thank you , God . 
This guy left two and a half minutes before the robbery . 
I can 't hold on any longer . 
They 're not interested . 
He was trying to cure himself . 
Forever . 
Thank you . 
Oh , god ! 
No , I didn 't even realize he was here till just now . 
You keep her alive , she 's your guarantee that I 'll keep my word . 
Take care .

What are you gonna do with all that ? 
What 's that about ? 
I didn 't write the rules , Mr. Hunley . 
- I swear . 
Mr Holmes ? 
Oh , what are you going to do now , DCI Luther ? 
Clearly , that 's me . 
I 've never been to a homecoming , okay ? 
Deal seems pretty one-sided . 
- For the Forbidden City ? 
I don 't know why it 's happening , but our family got a second chance . 
- It 's good for your mind . 
That doesn 't make sense . 
- I 've just come out of a relationship . 
Our highest priority now is safety .

Scared the shit out of me . 
Like molested ? 
I struck out . 
And so , like my friend , they 'll live here , on the Liberty Tree , forever .

Told me to find out who was behind it . 
And ... then she shot and killed him . 
I will retrieve the Quantonium myself . 
Oh , he knows . 
They had other plans . 
Yeah , one of them lost his mask . 
You know ... he gave me a phoney picture of Velma .

I should know , because that man 's name is me . 
What 's your first memory ? 
Shouldn 't I make you cum ?

Be advised , FBI vehicle has been recovered . 
- California . 
Then search there ! 
That 's cute . 
And when they 're done , seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives . 
Why can 't we find him ? 
Actually , we 're saying that you both planned to poison the cattle . 
- Lead the way . 
My love , what is it ? 
I 'm afraid you 're gonna have to come downtown with me , ma 'am . 
Allow me , darling . 
It 's like our hearts are in perfect sync with each other right now . 
Yes .

That 's all . 
What are you talking about , Percy ? 
They went out the back . 
It 's hard to talk if you 're going to be so cynical .

He got mixed up with a lot of really bad people . 
Where 's he going ? 
I didn 't notice that , at all . 
Oliver and I are over . 
God damn it . 
They ignore them . 
- Yeah , I get it . 
You 're joking . 
- I gotta go . 
I thought you killed him . 
I feel we should 've got a cheese plate for this guy . 
Why aren 't you at work ? 
We leave today . 
I don 't know , I only know what the police are saying . 
We have to find another way . 
What the hell 's the matter with you ? 
Not ' Liv , though .

Well , my philosophy ...

They 're too close . 
How pregnant is she ? 
Sorry , I must have- -

You 're a Lannister . 
Was that- - ? 
But it is not . 
You came here to talk about baseball ? 
I just gave you ? 
But no one will take me if I don 't know anything . 
- What do I have to go on ? 
Violent crimes involving ordinary people . 
You don 't even like people touching you . 
I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . 
For months , that 's what I couldn 't figure out . 
It is not safe up here ! 
Then as I am half human , your record remains untarnished .

You are telling me you are a bank robber ? 
It 's not too late . 
Help yourself . 
Hey , Runner . 
I didn 't have a choice . 
That seems like a dangerous job . 
You must rest . 
- What are you talking about ? 
We can discuss this downtown , sir . 
- You weird ... 
She had spectacular feet . 
Hit the water . 
She has cancer , Peter . 
And he , me . 
Drop it . 
Nowhere .

Okay . 
Become celebrities . 
Let 's go !

Sadly , yes . 
Then the ego steps in , the obsession 
You know what I 'd love ? 
Great , drilled right into the stucco . 
I saw a cat that smokes . 
Punishment , as if that accomplishes anything . 
How 's it coming ? 
That 's why I picked you . 
- " Forth Base " . 
Come on , go ! 
- Of course .

There you are . 
And you got hacked ? 
Autobots , attack ! 
The activation device , give it to me . 
Why would you look for Quinn at home ? 
Is that girl working you too hard ?

I think you might be confusing me with my sister Yvette . 
Please repeat the extraction plan back to me . 
Lee , this is police business . 
Or we can get Gretchen on the phone .

Now , I 'm going to ask you again ! 
Lung cancer . 
Why am I to blame ? 
But you can 't lie to me . 
And as you watched it , what did you think ? 
For your gift . 
You know , you 're nicer than you look . 
Just give it a shot . 
You want to get this one ? 
If it 's Nick , I can help . 
We 're just gonna scare him , come with us . 
We can work our way- - 
Explorer , do you copy ? 
I 'm gonna need a list from both of you .

- Deep enough . 
Very loose- - one mile minimum distance .

Nana , it 's me . 
We weren 't doing anything . 
You okay ? 
I mean , what can you do in the face of death ? 
You guys ever consider how annoying this might be ?

And I loved her so much . 
Your choice was excellent . 
This is the only way . 
North . 
I told them whom to trust . 
Well , think , Jules . 
Not enough to matter ! 
Who 's it for ? 
I know how to use it . 
This man is real . 
You have to believe that . 
I can tell . 
You know exactly what we 're talking about . 
I 'm not sure where he brought us .

Yet , he still destroyed it . 
Make your depth 30 meters . 
Give it to me . 
Wherever he goes . 
No , what do they say ?

Afraid not . 
It 's kind of gruesome . 
Why would we blind the single greatest watchdog 
But otherwise , very little help .

You get any pussy with that thing or what ? 
So no gun , huh ? 
We thought you were going to be with her tonight

My clients would kill me . 
So , in the presence of the archbishop , 
We grew up together . 
Because I did . 
Wednesday ? 
Remember ...

- I don 't know . 
And neither will I , as long as you let me pursue this . 
So she could have him again . 
I 've got beef . 
No tiger bear , no Russian soldiers needing our help . 
Jane is with him right now , and his life is in grave danger . 
We let Principal Celestia know all about this and those girls will be kicked to the curb in no time . 
Easy to cheat . 
Wait for my friends to arrive . 
You 're always careful , Sookie , about what counts . 
I thought so .

Which I realize is a kind of illusion , but that 's ... that 's how it feels .

But if Thorne puts me up against lady piggy , 
So you didn 't catch proper sight of this person ? 
I am Bowman . 
Oh , yeah , gimme this shit . 
Yes . 
So you have to stay open , 
He should 've been hit by a truck . 
It is the clothes , perfumes , the impression that you cause .

What if my interference makes it worse ? 
Don 't point your fokkin ' tentacles at me ! 
You 're still not feeling good ? 
Just hold these by her temples . 
The least pain ? 
Hey , look , look ! 
I was actually just thinking out loud . 
You had me at " kill the bitch " . 
I want it done as soon as possible .

Probably for something you 're not even aware of . 
Sometimes they go after Hannah .

I 'm sure this isn 't enough . 
An alloy of gold and other metals , minerals , argentite , and chlorargyrite . 
- She smokes . 
Hey , excuse me . 
This is highly illegal , And i 'm not even doing it now . 
- We 're just trying to help . 
What we must do now is continue to support and monitor your recovery . 
I bet you this place lights up like a peep-show booth . 
We think it could be a very rare protozoa , like a parasite .

KWLA relies heavily on such stories . 
Is he lost ? 
- You bastards ! 
Whatever you needed it to be , 
- Yeah , me too . 
- No . 
You are correct . 
- Yes . 
You don 't understand how powerful the forces are that are working against us here . 
We 're on it . 
I thought you wanted it darker . 
See you later . 
And you killed Count Dooku , and you rescued the chancellor ... carrying me unconscious on your back . 
I 'm going to find out what the fuck is happening on this island . 
Oh , my God . 
Six hours ? 
Fine . 
So we can keep these people out permanently ? 
You didn 't kill Viktor out of vengeance . 
Cheer up , Polack .

Daniel and Adina . 
I 'm not going to go along with this anymore . 
And do not let her see that checking .

Karen , I need to talk to you . 
Starting there , let 's just narrow down our list . 
There 's a lot of stuff here . 
And your predecessor wasn 't willing to lean on him . 
Man , I cannot wait to get the hell out of this Podunk town . 
How long can you continue this ? 
I mean , Alex believes right now he is in control .

I had to to do something to drown out the sound . 
Mr. Reese , do you know what this is ? 
Okay , whatever you get as soon as you get it . 
Bambi , wait . 
He 's going to inject himself .

You are a size ten , aren 't you ? 
What about you , Dennis ? 
Her wedding ring . 
Why don 't we say that 's lunch ? 
- He wants us to watch it . 
Hey , I got here as fast as we could . 
Maybe you don 't have to leave that . 
Well , okay then . 
- Just do me one favor , Ok ?

Ask me what I killed , seven trucks , five Jeeps , and one of those motorcycles with the sidecar on them . 
Tell your partner they don 't serve chimichangas in here . 
You work any cartel murders before ?

You need to get him to talk . 
This whole week on , week off schedule is driving me crazy . 
Within the hour I will have someone pick you up . 
I ain 't never going back to that place again . 
Would you believe I loved him once ? 
It 's not that simple . 
After the decades of fervent advocacy ... 
Did we win ? 
Love the outfit , Doc . 
- What do you want ? 
Well , we 're having trouble with a money launderer . 
Now they will fear the Greek men-at-arms ! 
I left Gellar in pieces in the swamp .

And I don 't even know what the hell I 'm supposed to be looking for . 
Did you get all that ? 
Prosser , are we ready ? 
- Yeah ? 
I concur . 
And a little bit later , why don 't you come by for a drink with us ? 
My term has been extended . 
- You know how long it 's been ? 
No , I don 't want this . 
We 're leaving right after dinner . 
I wish he 'd done more than threaten him . 
But then ...

That clever bitch . 
Oliver , can you hear me ? 
I , uh , came to apologize . 
Dagmar ? 
You know how many people die in this country every year ? 
He took us in . 
No one in the Agency knows shit but you and me .

I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley . 
Dad , Pauline told me . 
Chas , Chas , I 've got to go . 
So , what about this device is overkill ? 
It hurts . 
And I think you remember all of them . 
You don 't have to be polite .

Twenty . 
Hold onto the stirrup ! 
I suppose it all seems silly now . 
Except for a good reason . 
I understand I 'm in terrible trouble . 
Believe me , I asked myself that question every single day . 
Know what ? 
Helped the trip-eights act more human . 
You should speak to Captain Archer about a promotion . 
Who 's this ? 
I 'll handle Stiles . 
You keep asking me questions and my countermeasure protocol will initiate . 
And where are you from , Peter Lake ? 
I 'm wasting my fucking time here ! 
All right , guys . 
He cost millions of people their jobs . 
All right , you guys form a chain , send those bags back as fast as you can . 
What is it ? 
Just burn this shit down with some new routines .

ALL : 
- But where is this circle-jerk gonna take place ? 
Ya , you love sugar !

You said yourself there 's no body . 
Talk to Angela down the hall . 
Is there any way that we could radio him ? 
Come on , let 's go ! 
There she is ! 
Well , that 's not the plan . 
Surprised no bones were broken . 
Do l need to repeat the question ? 
It was only after that call she dropped off the map . 
- No . 
You shouldn 't be carrying it . 
What if we give her to you ? 
I see it ! 
This boy in your study group must be something . 
- Sounds heavy . 
- Hey . 
Leave me alone , I 've put it on . 
Now I don 't feel so guilty about sleeping with the boss 's daughter . 
Promise this 'll stay between us , then you can leave . 
And I begged for his forgiveness , and he gave it to me . 
Okay , so once I 'm back online 
Well , it 's a dangerous world out there , and we 're just penguins . 
Wow , those are expensive cars . 
Why not ? 
That was kind of hot . 
Yeah , going for a non-threatening , huggable kind of thing . 
- He 'll be here . 
No , I 'm kidding . 
No , have you ? 
Woopty-doo . 
Kristen , nobody came in here . 
Now , they would need a pallet jack to get the radar out . 
Is that right ? 
We get it ! 
I know where he 's headed next . 
- Keys . 
Gushing profiles in blogs and national magazines . 
You all right ? 
It could look like someone you know . 
They seem like demons . 
You saved my life . 
My best friend in the world is in the hospital right now . 
- Don 't lose him . 
The judicial psychiatrist . 
Your children and grandchildren don 't want you to die , Matthew . 
You 're wondering why I 'm eager to help . 
Se he started a company in our dorm room . 
But you 're gonna go through life thinking that girls don 't like you because you 're a nerd . 
Don 't worry about me . 
Well , she insisted . 
Hey , you want to play some ping-pong ? 
Tracking solid . 
You must understand . 
How do you know that ozvuèen ? 
That was a urgent matter . 
- No , I do care . 
- We went to high school together . 
I need them . 
Goldie , get the door . 
She looked perfectly at home to me . 
Thanks for walking with me . 
Everyone 's okay . 
If there 's a reasonable doubt . 
I never wanted to inherit his household anyway . 
I know that Newcastle was a bodge job . 
- I don 't want my family 's name involved . 
The attacks stopped three days ago . 
She says you should have told her that when she was alive . 
Hi , you 've reached Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry .

Oh , this is going to be fun ! 
For God 's sake , Will . 
Ronnie the One-Man Band ? 
I 'm here to serve you . 
My device does not fit that description . 
He shows people how to live without phones , lights , that kind of stuff . 
I was reckless with your life . 
You almost sound concerned , Lionel . 
You 'd think we were being chased . 
No , I 'm afraid not . 
Thank you , Master Ford . 
It 's even got an uglier Decepticon with it ! 
Her lawyer never saw the will ? 
The camera stopped ten seconds ago . 
I am Judge Quinncannon . 
Yours affectionately , Sheeni . 
That 's what the warlock wants . 
Say 500 years , while he returned 
I 'll see if that makes an impression ! 
It 's not bad . 
We must face the long dark of Moria . 
It 's the cat . 
I mean , the thing 's pointless , though . 
How do you figure ? 
Follow me . 
A token of my appreciation for all that you do for Margot . 
You 're Arya Stark . 
Quick , get in . 
I 'm not sure . 
Remember the old Russian saying : 
" I will leave you clues that will lead to Emily . " 
Eleven . 
No , I said inadvertently . 
- Thank you Thomas . 
Get it done ! 
Ending it , now ! 
What about the dealers filing suit against you ? 
Poor girl . 
- Animal . 
I had no choice . 
Otherwise , you wouldn 't have begun volunteering at the prison library , where he works . 
Which means you weren 't on your way to heaven 
So you 'll stay and say your words with me ? 
Her body , I mean ? 
He doesn 't confide in me anymore . 
He thinks you 're in trouble . 
It 'll have stuff that we can use . 
Krumitz , we got to wire the tablet 's battery into the car 's starter . 
I know . 
What are we talking here , herpes ? 
And do you know what he 's doing now ? 
We 're sitting around Willow Creek ... 8434 , base . 
Time to go . 
And you deserve that more than anyone . 
You have no business in Roman family quarrels . 
Yes , it 's a deal . 
How bloody do you think it 'll be ? 
I need to speak with the Frenchman . 
Here we still are . 
Well , that 's another question . 
You tell me , what am I gonna fucking tell people now ? 
" The Red Hood Gang " ! 
I got a few more years on my pension , Harold . 
Really ? 
For example , my real name is Kremenski .

In your food . 
Nikita , chip is down . 
That 's ironic . 
Where 's Scylla ? 
For everyone else as well . 
- Watzinger . 
You think your wife will give divorce ? 
l want to help my country . 
What if the whole planet is the mechanism ... and the treasure is buried in the centre of this planet ? 
Now we 'll stay here and defend the children . 
I don 't know , maybe the Ledoux boys knew you . 
Who we gonna be next , Tommy ? 
Moving in together , but we have to be honest . 
Me , either . 
So why don 't you get down and let me finish up , please ? 
Mom , I don 't want to go ! 
He missed you a lot , you know . 
- Give me your hand ! 
Perhaps , if things continue ... 
That 's what the note should say . 
He just makes a point to be there for me . 
Somebody got to that judge . 
Why don 't you just get in your rocket and fuck off back to Legoland , you cunts ! 
His wife ? 
One night , in bitter despair , I ... 
- Did you find him ? 
You seemed kind of upset . 
Yes , that 's ... 
- Mine ? 
- Told you that , did he ? 
Birds have to eat too . 
The one you assured me you had under control ? 
What about her ? 
What 's this ? 
The people she dealt with must have done her in- - other dealers . 
Pretty as a picture . 
You 're trying to get me fucking killed . 
She 's boarding her bus . 
Fixee ? 
No , I walked out of the office and got back to my tables . 
He said he was a friend , a friend of Alec 's . 
- Sure , with a web cam . 
What does London- - love the cartoons , but this is an English class . 
Nom de plume , I have a CB handle . 
Mr Poe , listen to me . 
Getting some fresh air . 
There 's a CT Officer named Benton . 
- You 've always said- - 
If you 're not going to kill me you don 't have a choice - . 
You 'll be awake the whole time . 
My place is here . 
Did you know my father ? 
We are going down ! 
No ! 
Abby , it 's been like four minutes . 
If you could send it to that address , please . 
There 's a bomb in the oven . 
I 've been away . 
I don 't know . 
So , um , will you start riding the bus again ? 
So you wanted me to see all of this , then , did you ? 
" .. with lifespans twice as long as our own . " 
Keep firing ! 
It 's what you were trying to burn with those bank bags . 
So ? 
I 'm aware of that . 
Did she faint ? 
Now . 
- You were having trouble sleeping . 
Estas huyendo de algo ? 
She said she didn 't hear it , but I don 't believe it . 
Honey , it 's under your bed . 
'I trawled Ronnie Holland 's phone records . 
- Jane . 
I forgot to unhook the trailer . 
Holmes , I thought you were still at the scene . 
Madam , don 't get carried away like that ... 
I guarantee you nobody knows London 's waterways better . 
And we may have the evidence to prove it . 
I still am yours . 
We have to find that e-mail message . 
You really don 't like him , do you ? 
From over Duluth . 
I was going to take out the cop . 
That 's not mine . 
The aorta was torn . 
It blocked my sight during the day . 
Don 't be . 
Yep , there it is . 
It was Brody who broke her heart . 
- Hey , stop that . 
Oh , yes . 
Way to go . 
I 'm thinking of the words of the great Clarence Thomas . 
Wow , hello there . 
Anywhere . 
What about you , Mr. Castle ? 
Hi , buddy . 
- My phone . 
I found John Bowden . 
- She 's getting so hard to control ... 
What about the hot chocolate ? 
♪ But we can win it 
and that you 'd harnessed the ultimate power . 
We need to find that road quick . 
You look like a fucking ballsack . 
This game we playing , we don 't got the street cred to survive it . 
A towering intellect . 
And , yes ... 
It 's acidic . 
" He races home every night by midnight ... " 
Thanks , but I don 't know what 's going on yet . 
Like a real human does 
- And what 's that ? 
So what were you arguing about at the office today ? 
- Very funny . 
Still , I suppose one of us ought to go . 
Your arm ! 
She has no idea what she is , let alone what they were . 
Bring the bottle back . 
Don 't go in there . 
Why ? 
" Love , John . " 
Oh , wait , let me guess . 
It 's wired to blow ! 
Stay with her . 
Cone of Silence here . 
No .

From my grandfather to my father , this has come to me . 
- So when do I get to call my mom ? 
Have a look , you see that ? 
Make your demands known to president taylor . 
Who 'll kick the Krauts to Japan ? 
I know you too . 
If something 's happened to him , it 's not your fault . 
It is a relative few in light of our long-term plan . 
She let him into the house herself . 
She 's got him . 
She 's buying the full toad , you know ... 
I shouldn 't have done it with someone like you . 
Hey , how 's everybody doing ? 
I know where he is . 
My mystery man had left me with more than just a broken heart . 
Yeah , just hold on the other line . 
And no good at all in bed ! 
What are those losers doing here ? 
Colonel dubaku , i assure you we 've had very serious discussions regarding your demands . 
He can 't be trusted . 
Show me , Esmeralda . 
I 'm sure he 'll wait for us here . 
It 's the pigs ! 
He sends his love . 
Wait a second , is that Kenny Powers walking in my showroom . 
The questions kept coming up again and again , like bubbles in a case of soda . 
I can 't even fucking drive . 
No , thank you . 
Whose $ 2 million ? 
You bastard ! 
The camera , Bang " . !

And what is going on ? 
Check out that hat . 
Joan Watson , meet Gareth Lestrade . 
At the time , I was just thinking of the science of it all . 
We did it ! 
It 's locked . 
Beautiful , isn 't she ? 
Wait , how are you so calm ? 
The documents from your wife 's laptop . 
This time . 
Now all of a sudden , he started following Sam around like a little puppy . 
You guys okay ? 
l should ? 
Your hair 's growing back . 
Where are you gonna go for a walk ? 
Can you do that across the entire city ? 
Just pass it along . 
It 's all here . 
An ass that makes you want to crawl inside and take up residence . 
I know what my role is in this , Javier . 
The gods save me ! 
And he died . 
Let them fight . 
Poor sad little bread head . 
Mine , too . 
Steady your aim ? 
You know , one of those - - what do you call them - - 
What do you care ? 
I 'm-I 'm not following you . 
Trust me . 
That was a lie . 
Do we have a deal , Cyrus ? 
We have a problem . 
I am fine . 
A cult of werewolves ? 
Inner peace . 
Oh , look . 
Have you located Balleseros ? 
Uh , this is very amusing , but I 'm ... 
I thought you knew her better . 
It 's next to the couch . 
I don 't care . 
- Carrie , come on . 
Agent Dunham just left the Orpheum theater quarantine in a city taxi . 
The navicomputer is heading us right into the moon ! 
I mean obviously something is tearing you up . 
- It " s Kevin " s sister . 
You can do it ! 
That was my favorite . 
Till Shay 's back in this house . 
Something must have set it off . 
Come on . 
This time we 'll build a better town . 
I don 't like it , boss . 
Wait ! 
Oh , please don 't tell Sister Jude . 
This is , uh , this is very personal . 
There 's a bus . 
This isn 't about them being together . 
That 's the cleansing . 
Gretchen , you did it . 
We 've got a problem . 
You take care of this car ? 
If we can find some kind of pattern , maybe we could locate the source . 
You want to come with me ? 
- How you feeling , Grandpa ? 
We ... 
Let 's do this . 
It must be nice , never getting cold . 
Released by the particle accelerator explosion ... 
I 'm going to die .

I had a meeting downtown . 
Let 's go , let 's go . 
Hardman expected so much out of us . 
He has lost his mind . 
Backwards ! 
A little common sense . 
Well , someone else is sitting right here . 
Can we talk in the barn ? 
I 'm sorry , detective . 
... in an attempt to apprehend a suspect in the murder ... 
One week , max . 
I think I have a little work to do .

Take me down now . 
Right , Sue ? 
You know , where , uh ... 
Henry already figured this out , didn 't he ? 
An officer , not a soldier .

How do you know ? 
They asked me to bring it . 
He 's got Nat there , too .

Looks like that 's what your father thought . 
I 'll be back very soon . 
Lawrence is dead ? 
I know who my father is , it 's not you . 
Can those things stop him ? 
He was the priest of the temple . 
Whatever , man . 
Have you lost your marbles , too ?

Field trip day . 
- Care for some company ? 
So then you export it . 
What do you wanna do ? 
Why didn 't you evacuate ? 
I told you not to bring this one .

Do not leave my office . 
With Ms. Konatsu . 
- What are we doing ? 
That 's not an aberration . 
Suppose you love someone so much you just shut off your rational mind . 
That 's my pool you 're polluting . 
Look , I know I messed up , all right ? 
I wouldn 't let anybody else 's food near my mouth .

He can 't leave . 
He trapped us all in this house .

Is he getting more cheese ? 
- What 's the matter , kid ? 
Someone broke into my office . 
And he was my nephew as well , so what is that ? 
Erik , I can guide you through once you 're in .

Right . 
Stars sure are pretty , though . 
Go on , grab a seat . 
He 's not an ass-hat . 
Well , that 's .. how it works .

He 's selling love . 
Enough moping .

Thought you 'd help me find out why . 
I leave . 
He probably left as soon as he threw the kill switch . 
Yes , they can . 
Dagmar . 
Because Brown 's the most underrated offensive tackle in the business . 
- Stay in the car . 
How about turning on the light ? 
Is this Sean 's ?

I knew you 'd come back . 
That should just about do it . 
Classic . 
We 're going to have a 15-minute break and be right back here soon . 
Who are you ? 
You need to call the warden at Newgate . 
Tomorrow , we advance on the western front .

Did something happen to my daughter ? 
They were archeologists . 
Hang on , I 'll get you an iPad and some towels . 
The truth sure as hell came out . 
- Absolutely . 
You were right to fire me off the campaign . 
I don 't even wanna look at you ! 
It 's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook . 
And you 're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail . 
- Your son 's- - 
It 's not safe for me to use my usual surrogates . 
Get out . 
Yeah , okay , I made a mistake , but there was nothing else that I could do . 
What 's wrong ? 
It 's dangerous for him to go cold turkey like this . 
You can go home now . 
- Yeah , so ... 
I don 't get it . 
So here 's my advice stop spending my fucking money . 
Doesn 't mean it was present here .

And next to that , sedition , and next to that , revolution . 
What did John say to you exactly ? 
He slipped past you . 
You 're telling me I can 't tell you that I 'm following your own orders ? 
Know what happens when you corner a hornet ? 
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat . 
Only if you have boobs . 
Did he say where they were going ? 
Do we know ? 
all right ? 
Nobody move ! 
I think I might have skills that could be useful to you . 
He 's running . 
Well , it depends on your definition of the word obese . 
I 'm sorry . 
Own up to everything . 
You know , when I first met you , 
Then he takes his sweet time dealing with alison how he likes . 
2077 , my time , my city , my family . 
Can you identify it ? 
Did you know Pierrette was gone ? 
He 's breaking in , Finch . 
That 's because we 've kept it out of the media . 
Especially after Ivy breaks her kneecaps . 
- It don 't matter . 
What have you been up to ? 
But I do appreciate your timing . 
If I could pick any girl here , 
Unless you don 't want to be happy . 
Oh , and wings are almost ready . 
- Ezekiel , Jedidiah ! 
You only see what you don 't want me to be ! 
No one is going to vote for me after seeing this . 
There 'll be two men coming to find you shortly . 
I was just supposed to guard the warehouse and clean up when they left . 
When we start pumping the oil .

I-I mean , I was 17 or ... 16 ... 
With a good psychiatrist . 
- I 'm not Ganoosh . 
They wanna possess the bodies of the living . 
You son of a bitch ! 
There 's some dude out back with a flatbed full of scrap metal . 
Which way ? 
Next time , I don 't want to depend on some miracle drug to save me . 
So what 's for supper ? 
Other than that , damn fine police work . 
Hey , over here ! 
Just follow me , Henry . 
That counts as a turn . 
So will you assist me or not ? 
And , you know something else , Daddy ? 
- You can 't do that . 
- I want to be there when he wakes up . 
It 's time to make your decision . 
Why 'd you think that ? 
Have you ever dreamed of a before you met him ?

Our daughter 's had some sort of episode . 
What is this ? 
You gonna tell me what this is all about or what ? 
Dalton was an alternate on the national steeplechase team in 2000 and 2004 . 
This guy 's not a trained operative , 
Remember what happened here that night . 
Maybe we should find out . 
How come I 've never heard of them ? 
This isn 't over . 
We have visual on a possible high-value target . 
No problem . 
Are you sick ? 
It 's not going to be the same .

No sir . 
What do you want me to do with it ? 
Yours , Aya . 
I fear it may not work at all . 
Good morning , mr. Ellison . 
What were you going to do ? 
We did . 
It should be in the National Galley . 
- Cobb and Marandino , too . 
- It is just an expression . 
Help ! 
She doesn 't love you . 
So do not ask me to say yes to this . 
It 's me . 
He has changed . 
Evenin ' , John . 
Us ?

Can anyone corroborate that ? 
You were brave . 
- Who is this ? 
Put your seatbelts on . 
He 's saying something stinks about you . 
Your Chief Training Instructor ! 
The code changes every two minutes . 
- Andy ! 
Boys can 't have all the toys . 
My thoughts to your thoughts . 
What does this prove ? 
That you had no place amongst us ? 
- A British officer and his airman . 
I believe these things have a weakness . 
You are just as weak as you 've ever been . 
- I guess . 
And we know how to break a code that everybody else believes is unbreakable . 
It was so bumpy that Getko felt it with all his guts ! 
- Daddy . 
Want . 
Who 's Tavitian ?

He guards the prison where the scarecrow keeps my dad , Rambo . 
How , exactly ? 
Now that we 're speaking together man to man , 
You took the dog out , right ? 
What happens after you escape the compound , Dave ? 
Get in .

YOU 'LL DO FINE . 
Give us a call so we know you 're okay . 
We 're not finished . 
That means I 'm next ! 
Actually , wait a minute . 
That 's not possible . 
Who left standing orders never to hurt Sherlock Holmes ?

Something happened on this ship . 
Story gets bigger every year . 
Like , on vacation ? 
Who the hell are you ? 
- Oh , are you okay ? 
Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear ? 
I 'm all right . 
I managed to screw up Marcus 's big heist , too , so ... 
It just , you know , hurts when I breathe , that 's all . 
I plead that you don 't go 
Of course .

She wouldn 't . 
Hey everybody , welcome ! 
He can still rip your arm off , though .

See that blond boy there ? 
Tell me your name . 
It could spare you a lot of heartache .

We gotta make sure this one does not get out in the public eye , so keep it tight . 
You asked for life , you paid for life . 
Fine .

So , uh ... can I see you again tomorrow ? 
I wish our lot were half as good as you . 
- You 're bad . 
They 'll make sure you go away for a very long time . 
Not today . 
We 're not looking to horn in on your turf . 
Me , too . 
- Yeah , this one .

Why did you end it ? 
We start her up and just ram the shit out of his truck . 
I 'm sorry about your room . 
She will not be a victim twice over .

- Should we retire into the study ? 
I knew you would try to turn this into a campaign to take power . 
No , no ! 
Yeah . from the mainland . 
She 's turning it around . 
Let me know if you need anything else , yeah ? 
These aren 't Jack or Sawyer . 
Wait a minute ! 
- I thought I 'd left the stove on . 
And you 're never going to have to leave there . 
You really think they 'll die if you shoot water at them ? 
( sighs ) I could use your help . 
That son of a bitch played me . 
I 'm Owen , a good friend of " the three . " 
Sure . 
- She cannot breathe ! 
Not your natural habitat , is it ? 
I hired you to help me figure that out . 
That 's not the same girl . 
- So you 're not mad . 
Will her sentence be light ? 
Oh , fuck . 
Just look at the flowers . 
Inhaling it would be a death sentence . 
Previously on AMC 's The Walking Dead ... 
Let me see her . 
I visited the bodega that 's down the street from peck 's office ... 
- It 's the first proper lead that we 've had . 
We can safely assume that we 're familiar . 
I think I can hack the power grid and shut down the lights . 
My memory helps with my work . 
That 's the language of the Primes . 
She didn 't call you ? 
I have access to information , and Karen wants information . 
Wouldn 't find your body till after spring . 
- Well then ... 
- Just talk to her . 
I have a problem . 
- Scout . 
And God help me if it 's another bone-dry pot roast ... 
You do . 
When that happens , take her to quarantine . 
Come on , we got to go . 
Will you look into it ? 
Yes , sir , Mr. Nitti . 
And it 's rent-controlled . 
But he just let her die . 
But wouldn 't " Sowoski " be more accurate ? 
They took all his stuff away for the investigation , and ... 
The crew are dead , killed by a radiation leak , the only survivors were Dave Lister , who was in suspended animation during the disaster , and his pregnant cat , who was safely sealed in the hold . 
Think of it as a game . 
I 've got a blister . 
Mom ! 
It didn 't solve anything . 
I could take you if ... if you wanna go . 
Yes , well , we 're not so keen to advertise our shameful acts , are we ? 
Am I supposed to be impressed ? 
'Cause that 's what we 're talking about . 
Prior to midnight we then run this wire from the tree to the water . 
My daughter is gone because of your arrogance . 
You will . 
You Swedish bitch . 
Give me the gun . 
Welcome , welcome . 
Can you describe who killed the man that attacked you ? 
What do you mean ? 
There are hundreds of these messages . 
Don 't judge a book by its content . 
Get out the door ! 
There 's gonna be riots in those ships . 
Where did you get that jacket ? 
The one that started it all for me . 
All you wanted was Nemec 's money and freedom . 
We did it ! 
The fact is , he has no proof of that--none whatsoever . 
You 've been beside me the whole damn time ! 
It barely missed her little girl . 
Good thing I learned to use that flight simulator app , huh ? 
That 's a little pet project of mine . 
It wasn 't Pete . 
Saint Francis , is that it ? 
He 's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister .

They got away . 
- Hey , Officer Mike . 
I quite liked having a ... wizard around . 
l 'm glad you came back , Sally . 
He 's only 2 years old and look how big he is ! 
Who the fuck are you ? 
Well , you 've got to make things right with Saul first . 
Divergent ? 
But if you don 't do what I ask , you 'll wish there was one . 
- Man , I knew you were gonna say that . 
She won 't be welcome in Scofield 's camp . 
Have you had any opportunity to further test her loyalty ? 
Let my life be sacrificed . 
Actually , I don 't feel that well either . 
Well , any baseball fan has gotta love this . 
Well done . 
Can I not get a squirt , even ? 
Or maybe it 's ' cause you know where his money is . 
They 're the best in the business . 
I know , but ... 
Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child ! 
- and of course Mr Edgar . 
You motherfucker . 
- So this is it . 
So , thank you for sparing us and helping us . 
I mean it , stop it please . 
No , sir . 
You okay ? 
You sure ? 
Oh , hey , Alicia . 
Um , only his name , Richard Conrad . 
Wouldn 't you like to know ? 
I mean , if he hooks up with someone else , I 'll feel like an idiot . 
I have acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 
I won 't be so easy to kill once we level the playing field . 
I should get going . 
I now have 400 healthy potato plants . 
What can you tell us ? 
I-I was here at the gallery going over paperwork . 
I would thank a God , if I believed in one . 
The conversations we 're having we can 't be having on cell phones . 
Worth nothing . 
- Strength in numbers . 
In the meantime , hang in there . 
- Come on , hun . 
- We 're in business . 
Giving your thoughts words encourages clarity . 
I know that 's not right . 
Why can 't we let him out ? 
What kind of something ? 
I 'm a vampire , not a bloodhound . 
He tied me up like a dog . 
Good morning . 
- Yes ! 
Carrie , my plane leaves in less than ... 
Try to blend in . 
About 15 civilians being loaded into a trailer . 
We 're not just five mooks with shotguns anymore . 
We 're just pieces being moved around somebody else 's board . 
If you won 't help me prove it , I 'll do it myself . 
Nine pints in and it was us against the world . 
Sold you out ? 
We 'll find it . 
Come on , Jeff , you scratch my back and I 'll kiss your arse . 
I will keep it in mind if another body drops . 
Keep bringing up Barcelona . 
Basement 's clear . 
We would have to work under the radar . 
Previously on V ...

Thanks , Dave . 
No . 
Class-A clusterfuck . 
Okay , come in the back door . 
She doesn 't want you here , either . 
Actually , they do . 
All kinds of scrutiny I spend my life trying to avoid . 
Where were you the night of the murder ? 
- There never was . 
And it 'll eat you up if you let it . 
And you have what ? 
What are you asking me to do ? 
Watched her die . 
A " knock " ? 
Uh , you have a missed call from Rich Levitt . 
People love the gory ones . 
Extortion , racketeering , three unsolved disappearances . 
At Jakar ? 
Ron 's done . 
Doesn 't help me fight , though . 
I selected that perfume for Nikita years ago . 
Then you 're a hero . 
It 's not a trick . 
Well , yeah , but they 're not like us . 
We elected him and he sold out ! 
Either way , you 're getting in the ring with me today . 
And is that why you favor it ? 
" What compensation ? 
He ... 
The only question is , when will the sky open ? 
- What point ? 
Get away , get away ! 
But the people loved him .

Gave me tips and stuff . 
Are you still watching ? 
We 're out of options , Travis . 
We were supposed to meet at 11 : 30 at the restaurant . 
- Will caring about them help save them ? 
If I 'm gonna do this , I 'm gonna need some moral support . 
The plans ! 
The 110 ? 
We need E.M.T.s. 
You think I did it ? 
Yes ? 
I never talk about him . 
Yes , that 's correct . 
I 'll get you some of those Mexican bombs . 
I didn 't know what would be worse . 
I recalled last night that

And your bags . 
Protecting you . 
Make sure I 'm safe ?

I 'm a good father ! 
I think you 'll live another hundred years . 
Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself ? 
- all this information ? 
I would have brought down the boss when we took down HR . 
I almost ran this over , genius . 
When do I take this off ? 
But there can be no turning back now and as my father once advised : 
And then if you want , I 'll get you another ticket to Portland . 
Free Julian Randol ! 
My father willed it to me before he died . 
Ford , take a sample . 
I know who you are . 
- He 's not with you ?

I told him the line was in trouble . 
Still , not particularly healthy , is it ? 
Actually , I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation . 
Business . 
You will die over there ! 
Please , agent Grace Van Pelt . 
Let 's just go home , okay ? 
I stopped looking at my books when I stopped loving life . 
Excuse me , sir , are you feeling all right ? 
Wha  s up , Gran ? 
Is that why you were surveilling him ? 
They 'd have me locked up . 
I just ... 
You haven 't slept at all ? 
There 's something ... 
- Yes , I am . 
The gate is closed . 
So 's that hairdo , but I figure that 's your business . 
So come back next week . 
Tonight . 
Simone didn 't have anything to do with this , Margot . 
I love life ! 
We got company . 
Sorry about that . 
- Can we please not ? 
I 'm gonna make this right , I swear . 
Do you like what I picked out for you ? 
Yes , thank you . 
Make me feel like you ain 't ever had it 
It 's time for you to tell your secrets to your husband . 
The toaster-looking thing . 
We 're fine . 
I don 't know , remember something that can clear Todd for good . 
- Thank you . 
I tried it once . 
Please just check whether or not she went back home . 
And , uh , I trust his judgment . 
It 's all about the mind . 
Uh , that sounds like you ... 
I 've been called to Washington . 
Go on . 
The what ? 
Well , not if we 're careful . 
And Amanda was gonna talk to her father that night ? 
♪ Come on and give me a chance to say 
Half the Targaryens went mad , didn 't they ? 
- We 're going inside , sir . 
Approaching crush depth , Captain . 
Is this some kind of signpost ? 
He ain 't been in trouble since he was a little boy . 
Who built you ? 
I 'm losing my window . 
Oh , I love the people ! 
It needs to be about 20 % cooler . 
Letting those torpedoes on board the Enterprise is the last straw ! 
Yo , this is crazy , man ! 
Now , if you do this right , there 's a big score coming down- 400 grand big . 
It 's all here . 
- Hello . 
Goodbye , old friend . 
I 'm ... 
I got news for you , cabrón . 
I said , didn 't I ? 
We don 't have much time . 
Get Back ! 
- Why don 't you just let her jump ? 
Forgive me . 
The way you look at me , the way you fantasize about me . 
Yeah , of course you are . 
What is this ? 
It 's best you don 't know . 
The Count ? 
- I can 't go back there . 
Where the hell you going this time of night ? 
WALTER : 
( SIGHS ) Who is that ? 
You know , you 've been on edge ever since we got off the plane . 
But if eight minutes passes on anything , I get bored . 
The answer is good-bye . 
Have you got a short memory or something ? 
You 're not the only one the government has betrayed . 
Thank you for shopping here 
You let that dealer , alexandra yee , run her scam 
Tell me ! 
You don 't want to do that . 
Okay , so , human intelligence entails ? 
And at this point , 
I- - we talk , we build models , we write letters , I got him this recorder . 
Get this out , right away . 
- He did ? 
They couldn 't have been made with socks ? 
Is that really you ? 
Get on the subway ! 
These guys have met Adam Shadowchild . 
Understood . 
- I don 't wanna be rude . 
Your aunt was such an elegant , attractive woman . 
This guy over here with his girl ? 
What is going on ? 
Well , it was just like a good friend once told me . 
I don 't know what you 're talking about , Carol . 
You must never rush out on the meadow . 
I couldn 't stand ... 
You remember when you caught Dad putting our presents under the tree ? 
Where 's el cohete ? 
- Those are all theoretical . 
Been better . 
- Really ? 
Can I watch ? 
- Don 't I always ? 
Just been working here the last 10 , 12 years . 
Hey , I 'm talking to you . 
Well , how she wanted to move out . 
- Ever feel abandoned , Will ? 
Yes , that one . 
I don 't think my eye holes line up properly . 
Okay , all right , all right , all right . 
You can stay with me if you need to . 
Top of the class . 
Hey , Earl . 
Whatever the reason , there are no almonds here . 
I actually can 't tell you . 
What am I some kind of fucking serial killer or something ? 
And before that can happen ... 
You got a handsome son . 
Heard you were looking for me ? 
Should be somewhere in the backlog . 
No , I didn 't know that . 
Another color-changing gem is the Alexandrite from Russia 's ... 
I 'll get out of your hair . 
Why did you come back ? 
You set us up ! 
You know how much I enjoy bankers . 
Helen , what are you up to ? 
I had to go through the archived files at the Bureau . 
I mean , a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this . 
- How about this ? 
She 'll be knocking all day . 
That 's what I 'm trying to do , okay ? 
Yes , it is . 
Pretty rational , right ? 
Let them go , all right ? 
You were a lucky duck . 
Like a bulldog or a wolf ? 
But it will lead them straight to you ! 
Not even my last wife sold for that much . 
It 's DCI Luther , actually . 
- Clear , boss . 
After that shooting ? 
He 's the puzzle master . 
The power grid is burned out . 
- Let me help you . 
You still playing ball ? 
Thea , we will handle this , I promise . 
- Where are you ? 
We 're almost there . 
Did your contacts at Section 6 tell you that ? 
Then why were you paying him ? 
- Reducio ! 
Probably running late . 
- Yeah , he 's all right . 
I 'm a sick person , Lance . 
You should go before ... 
Bring Brownie and Cupcake . 
- Shut up ! 
It 's about your brother . 
More money . 
Well , the official word is it will be close . 
- What does she like ? 
What happened ? 
Top of her class . 
This is embarrassing . 
If there 's one of them down there , they would have come out . 
That 's all we were allowed to use . 
- He knew the building backwards . 
Come on , guys . 
I don 't know their names or where they are . 
Guess what I found in his stomach . 
But I was ... 
This isn 't about friendship . 
Please look after Hagu You 're my only hope , Yamada 
Holy crap ! 
But only if we do it my way . 
I want the one that Carmine gave me . 
Uh , Rachel 's birth . 
I believe this one did . 
I mean , there 's hardly anything at all in there . 
Mayka has the power and money to vanish without a trace . 
- Wardo , I said I know . 
This is evidence . 
945 Clinton Street . 
You 'll never get this case open , I promise you . 
To a point . 
She wouldn 't do that . 
Time 's ticking , petty officer . 
That 's rock-bottom , you know it is . 
You wanna piss me off ? 
I 'll wake the volcano up . 
And if they hadn 't grabbed him , I could be dead . 
How many of these rooms have you seen ? 
- AIvin , manners . 
These will be the Divergent . 
Dr. Morgan . 
The only time I saw frobisher was with you . 
- Then who are you ? 
That Raisa would be saved ? 
Oh god ! 
Holy hell . 
You into horror titles ? 
I carried it to the elevator . 
How many languages can you speak ? 
What about clothes ? 
I can 't do this anymore . 
- It was for Brother Aidan ... 
I don 't trust anybody I 'm not close enough to kill . 
Who the hell do you think you are , mister ? 
Don 't shout ! 
That makes sense . 
And not that makes any difference ... but I wrote my dissertation on Hawthorne . 
I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us . 
Feels like the future I come from started here . 
Great , now we 're friends . 
And these . 
- Yes , I heard . 
- Oh , I 'm sorry ? 
Thank you for bringing it to me . 
Please don 't leave . 
Interned for Casey 2009 . 
How could you let this happen ? 
I don 't want you talking to me for the rest of the robbery . 
Who can tell if you do ? 
For if before men indeed they be punished ... 
I told you you 'd be pleased . 
- We 've come to see you . 
You okay ? 
Just be careful . 
I 've always tried to be good , keep the rules . 
How 's your mother , Holloway ? 
Received a coded retreat message we have . 
My dreams only tell me that I am damned 
And I know I 'll never let you take it . 
Why are you here ? 
Okay . 
Pizza 's pizza . 
You advised him on what to do with the money , didn 't you ? 
Have you guys seen the men 's room ? 
It 's hard to be patient listening to your crappy music . 
Think you can say a prayer for your old man ? 
Their orders come from the most zealous elements of the KGB . 
One second . 
Once Wannamaker 's down , he 's down . 
You tell me . 
I don 't know if it 's what I wanted to know . 
Of course I want to see you ! 
Enough to get a GPS fix ? 
Testy . 
My dad died . 
- Thick and heavy ? 
It wasn 't like you were gonna let him near a computer . 
I 'm sorry about that kiss the other day . 
l 'd die for her . 
- I like griping . 
one min farhan one min idiot .. then why did u call us over here ? 
Well , I do . 
We are free to resume our lives . 
We 're just catching up . 
- They 're going to kill her . 
You know , Richard , 
And the morning 's when I wanna * * * * you 
Ain 't no way you could 've handled it . 
Not both ? 
Let me ask you this ... 
But hypothetically ... 
Ah , crispies ! 
" Just at that moment , 
Aung San Suu Kyi , you are officially 
The universe , yours . 
To track a strong electromagnetic field . 
Thanks , Mum . 
You just let it run a little , it 'll clear up . 
Because it 's not his fault . 
But not all are created equal . 
Have fun , though . 
It 's right there ! 
Just give me one second . 
The Skitters that you saw are rebels fighting with us . 
The New York branch of Diogenes ... their idea . 
I just don 't let them see it . 
I will blow us all to hell . 
- You 're not considering it ? 
Let my other man choose his crew . 
So I 'm meeting with Senator Ferguson . 
No , My Lord . 
What do you want ? 
It would start with the doctors and the nurses . 
Lord Stark ! 
Oh , i love this song . 
Okay , I 'm leaving now . 
She was one of his . 
Who do you know ? 
I swear you that I will make it . 
Sorry . 
Nothing , Papa . 
Pull him ... 
Yeah , but the carrier hasn 't received a signal since last night . 
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping ? 
Boys or men ? 
It was riveting . 
I did not get that at all . 
I 'm supposed to believe this ? 
Evil ... 
I 'm making really good headway ! 
- Sir . 
Arriving at the prison now . 
Adrian says everything should check out . 
See you . 
Climb on . 
That 's why he made you his prisoner . 
I need you to come with me . 
The fuck are you saying ? 
It 's good to see . 
If we want to be with them we have to go now . 
Now , why is that ? 
Proceed no quicker than 10 meters per minute . 
You get me credible intelligence against the Company ... 
I always hoped to do a woman before I died . 
You do remember how that ended ? 
Ernie and Rich . 
My name 's Walter Jr . 
You okay ? 
I was a swim champ back in high school . 
Just one last question . 
Right near JR and Sue Ellen . 
See the game ? 
I wish he were still alive . 
And she didn 't seem sick to you ? 
Yeah , same as Brian Barrow . 
Hurry ! 
And I 'll see what our undercover can dig up . 
Please , Harold . 
Who the hell do you think you are to bestow judgment 
He kicks , I shoot . 
Sorry to be a busybody . 
You may kiss the bride . 
- It 's ... 
- Why are they stood outside ? 
- It was an order . 
Do you know what it takes to unite 
I never got ' round to telling her , but she was gonna come with me to Fiji . 
Now they 're out there in the night doing God knows what . 
Why are we dragging him along ? 
Where is here ? 
My compliments . 
These are all viable suspects . 
A.S.D.S. has cut engines , commander . 
There 's no sign of Lisbon . 
What 's it this time ? 
Had something in my eye . 
Nobody seems to know . 
Are you not entertained ? 
I think Watson and I could do great things here . 
Maybe the humans will surprise us . 
Let it out . 
Yeah , or make one . 
Is that a precious thing to you ? 
as a reminder 
- What mistress ? 
We know you work for Tommy Volker . 
Isn 't the redundancy exactly what is needed here for safety ? 
I know because I built it . 
What do you think ? 
- Angelbay . 
The professor knew we were coming . 
I 'll track De Luca inside , then I 'll report . 
I just got this , you know . 
Who are they ? 
To men in white suits with happy pills . 
Don 't forget what i said . 
All right , so now we 've got three days to kill . 
What are you doing here ? 
Come on , Bullock , you know you 're scared of this case . 
Tell him that Keane has served money on all of us . 
I have it . 
But ... what I want ... 
Find me 20 more , cut you in . 
I heard the moans . 
Broken rib . 
Dr. Washington , Detective Martinez , Lucas , good to see you all . 
You got a hold on me , right ? 
Yeah , yeah , it is . 
- What I said about your hair . 
He asked me to proof it for him . 
I hated every day , and thought I wanted to die . 
And I will find out exactly what happened that day . 
Even Dan ? 
Wondering why they bother . 
You want this to happen , didn 't you ? 
It 's okay , you can touch . 
Okay , why ? 
I 'm out of sleeping pills . 
And if we get lucky , maybe you can get lucky . 
Booster separation complete . 
You did not ... 
- He 's one of them . 
You really like me ? 
I didn 't see that coming . 
But we are fugitives . 
- I 'd like you to continue . 
They belong to me ? 
Flass is protected . 
No money , no jewels ? 
This shit that we 're a party to 'cause we pay taxes . 
Didn 't see hardly nobody . 
What are you looking at ? 
The American pilots flying escort now go for every kill they can score . 
How long was I out ? 
Nice to meet you too . 
Not that I could remember . 
I can 't see you again , Paul . 
- You were right the whole time . 
Let me examine him , please ! 
You want to tell me why ? 
[ Scoffs ] Mediocre ! 
You didn 't listen to what the doc said , did you ? 
I don 't need your approval , Dr. Edison . 
What is it ? 
I just had to stop . 
How would Mr. Widmore know that ? 
And I 've come home 
Is it the medication ? 
There 's a dead woman in our loft ... 
You did ? 
- Whoa . 
Let them have what happiness they may ! 
In your travels , did you ever encounter a man named Khan ? 
What 's this about , exactly ? 
You will tell me now how they are planning to take me . 
I paid for treatments . 
You must be Alfred Pennyworth . 
Yet you sent five men to arrest me today . 
What , especially if he 's jealous ? 
Next . 
- Is this yours ? 
I saw you . 
It 's so good to see you Ted . 
He wants to hurt me . 
It was you , wasn 't it ? 
Yeah , that 's where I am right now . 
Please don 't call it that 
- Jay , it 's your turn . 
His gun turret , however , was immediately put into service . 
So , my name is Masood ... 
- Leave me alone ! 
I wouldn 't have been a very good husband if I didn 't help . 
And who told you for a fact that Beltran killed Huff ? 
So what ? 
- Take him away . 
It means that this damn thing doesn 't work at all ! 
One day at a time , just like we talked about , right ? 
- She was in Auschwitz . 
Enjoying the chicken ? 
Juli , you did a really nice job on your yard . 
They treating you all right ? 
- Right . 
Maybe . 
The God 's Eye . 
There are too many enemies in the South . 
Use your words How did it make you feel ? 
She can never know about the machine . 
But I 'm telling you the same I tell kings and queens 
That we can 't eat . 
You have nothing to worry about . 
I can 't help it . 
I know you 're Israeli . 
Somebody 's shooting up the school . 
Thank you , Claudia . 
And in the end , he was enjoyed as coffee . 
But , uh , tell you the truth ... 
This is not making much of a difference , is it ? 
- Are you ok ? 
- It is for you to decide that . 
You did what only a true friend would do . 
Could we do dinner tomorrow night , maybe ? 
If they haven 't killed him already ... 
The only question is , how did the tetanus enter the dead woman 's system ? 
Smart woman . 
I also would like to report that the MAV is still upright . 
It 's the way the game is played . 
Where is Zoey Tan ? 
- Oh , thank you . 
Me , in a bear chest contest ? 
May I ? 
Two weeks ? 
- Yeah you can all wipe those smirks off your faces . 
Stop it ! 
- Yes , it is . 
About last night ... 
- Where is Paul with food ? 
I suggest you do it now . 
Look , I 'm gonna save us all a little bit of time here . 
I 'm sorry . 
The flying monkeys are coming . 
A whole lot more than one year older . 
I 'll settle up here . 
He 's beautiful . 
Uh , you have a brother , Frederick Calvert . 
General Kenobi , General Skywalker . 
Deploy all operatives into the field . 
Oh , I understand . 
They told me when to go to bed . 
You kept on non-stop ... 
I gotta tell you what happened . 
I won 't lie to you , Neo . 
Makes you feel alive . 
Closed officially . 
Leave us . 
Is the probe going to be ready on time ? 
We have two sets of remains . 
- Morning , Frog . 
What 's your name ? 
They lived like they had money . 
For both of you . 
That 's better . 
- A bomb ? 
You breached protocol ? 
You remember seeing him at the bus stop ? 
I trust you 're keeping yourself busy , Mr. Elias . 
I started the marriage out with a lie . 
Ready ? 
They thought it was a barbarian raid . 
- Yeah , I said so , didn 't l ? 
This may take me a little time . 
I know how disappointing this must be . 
No offense to you . 
We talked to a local merchant . 
This is the first time we 've left the house . 
You don 't think they 'll let us settle in Canaan ? 
She 's isolated him , Finch . 
Quite looking forward to it . 
Sure as hell didn 't do nothing for your father . 
Anything else ? 
Nice . 
Thank you for inviting me . 
I 'm doing all right . 
Name ? 
I staked his places out for weeks . 
Not going back . 
- What was I saying ? 
Pretty things . 
I 'll deliver Melekhov right away . 
I got 34 . 
Calm down , you 're okay . 
All right . 
She 's not going anywhere . 
How about a glass of wine ? 
Am I taking out any more cameras , Finch ? 
My mom bought those for me ! 
And Hollis paid her to- - to deal with it . 
He 's alive ! 
Gas ! 
That 's a fucking lie . 
You seen this one ? 
Look , I didn 't want you doing anything you weren 't comfortable with . 
The report is only a fragment ... from a probe droid in the Hoth system ... but it 's the best lead we 've had . 
I am C- - 3PO ? 
No , there are recovery programmes . 
It " s Graham , you need to get over here now ! 
Anyway , it didn 't end well . 
No promises ! 
Puedo mandar un oficial para que te traigan el coche ? 
Whoa . 
And what did you tell him ? 
I believe in second chances . 
But this is not my home . 
Then how is Upton 's murder connected with the gem heist ? 
Can I ask a personal question ? 
Of course , a dead end . 
Truth or dare ? 
Where 's Charlie ! 
This many people ' ? 
End of the world ? 
You can be pretty tough yourself . 
It doesn 't matter who Saeko-san goes on dates with . 
Detective West . 
Staircase is narrow . 
I don 't understand . 
Robbie where are you ? 
- Can I talk to you for a sec ? 
Meaning what exactly ? 
- That kid better wake up . 
I need something for a wound , I guess you 'd call it . 
Mankind could rival God , Himself . 
What the hell is going on with you ? 
Check your weapons and lock down your gear . 
Well , maybe the D.E.A. was wrong . 
Please don 't slam the door 
But we 're gonna need vehicles to transport us there . 
We need you to take her back ! 
- You 're empty . 
Come and spoon me . 
There was nothing left of either . 
Mind the gap . 
- Gross . 
He is protected . 
- Oh , you and your mother . 
I don 't ever remember Ben ever having a girlfriend . 
I know that . 
You should 've loved me , Barnabas . 
Remember ? 
You can 't move the desk . 
I 'm in position outside the UN compound . 
I can 't help feeling responsible for what happened to Franklyn . 
There 's a new wave coming into D.C. 
- Safety first . 
The one they work for . 
Sure don 't want to spend the night out here alone . 
Chabert , I just told Mr. Rachin that Mathieu 's chorus is sensational . 
If there 's any problems , you 're just a phone call away . 
But I didn 't want to let more time pass without having a word . 
I know , I 'm sorry . 
Look ... 
Thanks for not making me beg . 
May I come in ? 
Please . 
He slept here on the couch half the week . 
That truck belong to you ? 
Life 's too short . 
I am tired from the gym and a massage , so I 'm gonna get this cab . 
Nothing about us to feel horrible about . 
I 've got a wiretap on that computer . 
We 'll be up in a minute . 
You 're crazy about that dancer . 
I 'm fine . 
Never fails . 
Well , you 're all right . 
I see where you 're going with this . 
Especially if you 're in any kind of danger . 
And today , she can 't look the groom 's father in the eye . 
You can 't . 
Eight rooms on Park Avenue , he 's tapped out . 
So you and your son see anything suspicious lately ? 
The scampi and champagne risotto , please . 
- Attacks of ... 
Shelly listen , I 'm not leaving , so , think about it . 
The prince is not free to marry for love . 
Some specter approaches . 
You don 't think anybody else 's voice would 've got Moose to that motel ? 
That you aren 't anyone 's mother . 
Agent Van Pelt . 
How , exactly ? 
Uh-huh . 
And his wife just arrived . 
I 'm a hard worker . 
It 's gonna take at least three of us . 
These , right ? 
Your streets are safe ! 
- Please . 
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off . 
I mean , where did the Romulans get that kind of weaponry ? 
I think you and Smith should leave now . 
Plus they got that disease place . 
I 'm not sure she would even eat . 
You got any sparklers in there ? 
Ladies and gentlemen if you 'd like to follow me , please . 
What is the matter ? 
You asked if ever I was surprised . 
Watch what ? 
- All right , this will be easy . 
Yes , they do . 
And he said I could get started in the meantime . 
Surely you don 't want your mistress traveling ' broke . 
It didn 't make anything better . 
But the Cooper I knew couldn 't even use a hammer . 
Attack vector 177 . 
You smuggled files that belonged to the UN ... out of the mission . 
You did not just say that to me . 
He just meant Wade didn 't kill your parents . 
Carter , I 'm going to buy you a coffee . 
- You slipped on ice . 
She 's insanely jealous , she 's irrational , and I 'm frightened of her . 
Hey , you . 
How can you even find your way out of the dark ? 
I can 't leave Danny , I 'll lose custody . 
I 'm waiting . 
I got him . 
" the means to save your beloved 's life ? " 
Of course you can . 
Well , it looks like it 's unanimous there , Jess . 
I think he 's hungry . 
He says he 's building me a swimming pool . 
You 're trespassing on private property . 
It 's a treasure map ! 
Oh , hey , what 's up ? 
so this is the team ? 
Just once ! 
Well , make yourself at home . 
I really don 't think I can go out tonight . 
That 's not legal . 
Uh , just give me your number , and I 'll call you later . 
And on and on it went . 
And they were all real ... 
If the colonists found that ship , there 's no telling how many of them have been exposed . 
By killing people . 
Be brief ? 
- He didn 't need to suffer ! 
- Thanks ! 
- How did you get it ? 
I guess I just expected to get your voicemail again . 
Mr. Frobisher , open this door , please ! 
He is alive . 
- You a Catholic ? 
This better not go straight to my thighs . 
No , no , no , but there 's something huge in the park , and I 'm just saying we have a major - 
This door stays open . 
I must have blacked out . 
Well , surely there must be somebody 
Come on , come on , come on , come on . 
That one look like the nutsack on a water buffalo . 
Is he at the lab ? 
Does Mr. Hightower know ? 
Uh , Charlie 's just upstairs changing into her P.Js. 
No more surprises , Lincoln . 
Everything all right up there ? 
That is incredible ! 
Some of them are hopped up on speed . 
What did you do to him ? 
But , you know , if anyone knows , it 's Senator Mayer . 
You guys keep practicing on that badge . 
Reminds me of when we were in college . 
- What ? 
- Sure . 
Madison , he tried to stop it , okay ? 
What she should have had was a ride home . 
Good morning Miss Van der Berg . 
She 's sure to hear this one . 
No , dude . 
- It 's a little car . 
What 's that ? 
Just a million different ways to get what you want . 
They routed it to us on a priority channel . 
- They 're drawn by sound , right ? 
I 'll talk to you later , OK ? 
Walter , people from other universes don 't just show up in your dreams . 
I 'm totally sleepwalking ! 
The next T. Rex feeding will begin in 10 minutes .

Take a look . 
Well , half that money 's legally mine .

What happened , honey ? 
Lousy move . 
How did she seem lately- - Just , you know , any enemies or ... 
Those men had their chance .

How long does it take ? 
A prime takeover target . 
No , stay here and cozy up with me .

So the men get stuck into the intruder , who makes a break for it and gets away . 
That investigation was dropped . 
- So , what am I doing now ? 
For sure . 
To ? 
My beautiful wife . 
It 's a murder investigation . 
This was supposed to be a robbery . 
Our military leadership is very interested in your work . 
I know . 
My idea was to cover him with brush , not to rob him . 
And fear is the most amazing emotion of all because it creates complete awareness . 
If he was murdered , surely his wife had motive .

You leave , you don 't tell me where you 're going . 
It 's all right , honey . 
Ohh-kaaay ! 
By November she was gone . 
What can I do for you ? 
Not a goddamn thing . 
You know where that might be ?

I didn 't say that . 
I need to find out who these people are and what they 've done with the returned .

You and I went to the opera house together . 
What 's the matter , Piggy ? 
So , Ned , how long have you guys been married , then ? 
Doesn 't seem right . 
Hey , I thought you didn 't want to be late . 
Twenty-seven ! 
I just didn 't know how to ... 
- Valar dohaeris . 
Shall we go inside ? 
Stay here . 
Help us . 
Her husband Abbas ... 
Something wrong ? 
I 'm not sure . 
Urban warfare , sniping , close-quarter combat . 
Great work . 
I feel like a baby asking this , but ... 
It 's all right , San . 
Why don 't you keep them ? 
I 'm worried about Kit Kat . 
I already told you no . 
No , she talks too much . 
He 's offering up a trade . 
Thank you . 
You 're no longer tied to a desk . 
Do you want something ? 
Six years , all I thought about- - 
The Thirteen have spoken . 
I 'm not going to say a word to Sister Jude . 
Tell me ! 
Targets look good . 
Put your arm around Dillinger . 
Roger , wait out . 
- That 's disgusting . 
I 'm the one with the photogenic mind . 
Love didn 't just happen to us . 
- Thought there might be . 
Besides , he was already too far gone . 
Ako will be disgraced .

Well , it is not for sale . 
But not . 
Why are you looking at me like that ? 
I mean , how are you gonna get to him at the D.O.D. ? 
- I can 't get a pulse back . 
But you didn 't kill them . 
7 . 
I 've broken a sacred vow . 
So what 's this Egyptian guy have to do with my DOA ? 
Nothing ? 
My daughter , Carol Ferris . 
What 's your name ? 
Stay strong , John . 
Open the door . 
I never realized you had such respect for Dorne , Lord Tywin . 
You wouldn 't know a hospital corner if it bit you on the arse . 
How do you know he wasn 't just telling you what you wanted to hear ? 
Zoey is getting worse . 
At the studio ? 
Otherwise , he 'd be serving a life sentence . 
I patch you up , and then you are gone . 
Got him in my sights now . 
I 've got nothing to hide from you . 
That 's a fact . 
Maybe you should fingerprint him . 
Like the one percent of the one percent . 
And I 'm part of it all . 
He called me a troll , which I 'm not . 
Ma ! 
That 's one of the best clean shots 
Will you excuse us , please ? 
He said he 'd get me my money , but he needed his phone back . 
Five grand gets me 50 ? 
'Cause you were the one that made me take the risk . 
I work in I.T. 
It 's kind of a mixed bag . 
We come as friends . 
Which seems such a shame . 
Curtis Bradshaw . 
You woke the dog . 
- You 're done . 
John , come in . 
I 'm sorry , Sarah , we looked everywhere . 
Give me back the Dagger , so that I can take it there .

I can 't . 
And you think Cole 's gonna be waiting for her ? 
The bullet through the heart . 
This place definitely doesn 't look too shady . 
Let 's see how fast you are . 
That was a lie . 
- What ? 
- Maybe I can ... 
How does that happen ? 
- Happy New Year , Jacob ! 
Yes , and we think the same . 
I have an idea on the issue . 
You surrender rather easily . 
Hey , that 's my Tumi that you 're sliding over . 
My ... 
Good night . 
And so he told me his secret formula for happiness . 
You look like a little boy in the bathtub . 
I assumed a woman as beautiful as you ... 
You know , we have , uh , mentors at the Community Center for kids with special interests . 
Ah , you 're back with us , huh ? 
You gotta get back on the horse . 
No , you can do more . 
They looked after him . 
And I made a lot of decisions I regret . 
Look at the stained glass . 
They have the money . 
Step back . 
- One little kiss . 
Mr. Vice President , I believe Juma came here to humiliate the president and stage a public execution . 
So , you know what he is and you 're okay with that ? 
There you go , son . 
- leaving rock salt . 
You can negotiate practically anything . 
Are they serious ? 
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos . 
I 'm okay . 
- I would 've heard about this . 
I know you think that Volker killed Cassie Flood . 
Mm-hm . 
What do you mean ? 
Our techs found pipes in your car made of zinc , copper and polyethylene . 
I wasn 't . 
Goodbye , sweet child of mine . 
There she is ! 
Yes , yes , yes . 
All right , open ' em up ! 
Four to embezzlers , white-collar criminals , one to a rapist , one to a murderer . 
I know you . 
Come on , move your ass . 
- Let 's go see guillermo . 
So how are you , then ? 
Well , maybe I 'm getting out of that line of work . 
Oh , this is one of my favourites . 
You got a million calls while you were out . 
Are you still open ? 
If there is a key there must be a door . 
You 're not listening , sir . 
At some point , everything 's gonna go south on you . 
Uh , he 's not returning my calls . 
Okay ? 
And the name is Ginormica . 
There were seven more before him . 
That 's true . 
I 'd like you to reopen Jessica 's case . 
Where did the money come from ? 
Sorry I 'm late . 
What you see ? 
Do you know what I fantasize about ? 
You think I 'm that P.O.W. ? 
And if I can 't remember ? 
You , Sacaja ... 
I 'd love to show you around , but you gotta be on the classified access list . 
And don 't tell Jerry Lee about selling ' the old man 's gun . 
This ship has minimal aft weapons .

So if my heart stops beating , 
Aren 't you tired of hiding your true self ? 
Fair enough . 
She can 't teleport . 
A baby that keeps me up at night , a wife I want to make happy . 
Here , it 's this thing here . 
- Let me show you . 
Come to the window . 
Look out ! 
Everyone is on their feet . 
She 's just using you to get to Rayna . 
But building the machine is not one of them . 
You know , I can 't hear you , you talking to my deaf ear . 
Give me your hand , or don 't . 
You 're heavier than you look . 
- I 'm so sorry . 
I ain 't giving you shit , Stackhouse . 
None of this is your fault . 
Put the hook in , so you 'd wanna share the loft . 
I had already plotted this with Huo 's subordinate , Yin Po .

We landed in the water . 
And no one 's gonna bend or break me

Something that was born out of decades of secrets . 
We were gonna go find a farm in Argentina and settle down . 
Stop shouting at me . 
I 'm looking for Agent Lisbon . 
You 're married . 
With a little boy in the crossfire ? 
These Americans are causing a lot of trouble to us . 
I want you to give it to an agent , Larry Moss .

What I will give him is a fake . 
We were all left in the dark when you went awol . 
All ready , sir ?

Put me to work . 
Assistant DA Landon Walker . 
And wake up where the clouds are far Behind me . 
Did Kati like to go up to the mountains a lot ? 
Did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed ? 
But even if we take Juma down , the president may still be in danger . 
- You think this is about my job . 
I think it might be food poisoning . 
The vines just took hold of her , and they wouldn 't let go . 
I wanna bring him in for questioning . 
We could be even closer . 
I 'm sorry . 
Was it true , what he said ? 
That 's weird . 
I 'm not moving ! 
I think she just did what any mother would do . 
He 's the black guy . 
You want me to hang out with you ? 
It 's on ten ! 
In the time I 've known you , I 've never seen you beaten . 
That was before . 
What about that Gaston ? 
All right . 
Boys , we got this wrong .

Life seems different now ... 
I 'm going to take an Art class in the city . 
Is anyone here ? 
Bloody thieving Gypsies ! 
No , this way ! 
I 'm sorry , pinkskin . 
Which one ? 
I had hoped for a bit more . 
He 's black ! 
That one calls a hearse . 
Anyway , it 's not my father I 'm worried about . 
And I am none of these . 
So how 's Adam ?

You , you ... please , you help him , then . 
I was so in love with him . 
Did you see the victim leave the party ? 
Don 't be sorry . 
Maybe that was the idea . 
Hey , I 'm only a freshman . 
The only way to catch him is in the act . 
Some folks think that there might be more than one Spider-Man .

Look at me ! 
Something like what ? 
Don 't let me see your face till next month ... 'cause something tells me I 'm about to lose my famous kind streak . 
Hi , could I get these in to-go cups ? 
Did they find anything on it ?

Empty ! 
At the Herald , there 's no money for reporting , it 's all been cut . 
Someone 's taken his hard disk .

Mrs Watson , can I , can I get in , please ? 
Remy , nice to see you here .

I know that anger you 're feeling right now ... what it 's like to lose someone you love . 
Like me . 
This one 's especially lush 
Oh , not again ! 
Is there something we can do to keep us from showing up on their sensors ? 
- What does that say ? 
It 's a viable career opportunity . 
I know you never liked throwing anything away 
We 'll pop him when he shows . 
Already taken out six Kings . 
Stay out of my face , or l 'll go straight to Max . 
Just to the end of the street . 
Okay , then . 
Applying more suction . 
I honestly couldn 't tell you what that might be . 
Save it for the public inquiry .

Hatch the tail for me there . 
I can 't imagine she 'd be interested . 
Put the gun down . 
I need to know that you 're okay . 
You followed him to Dallas , too , didn 't you ? 
Kind of like paddles . 
She would sneak us in the back , put us up in the service elevators to meet the clients . 
I almost threw away a gold mine . 
So come on , Viking . 
Stark , we really need to get inside . 
This story just keeps on getting better . 
I 'm an American citizen and I have rights .

I will use that knowledge to save lives . 
Sounds like his sins have come back to haunt him . 
You run , Baum ? 
Neither does breaking your word . 
Maybe because you were just sick of death . 
Add a little heat .

Well , after I was done with the screaming part . 
I 'm sure it 'll be better next time . 
We 'd like you to run for Peter 's seat .

- You got what you wanted out of us . 
I 'll take them to the abbey tomorrow and tell the monks what happened . 
Come on ! 
Protect the food , the medicine ... what 's left of it . 
Look at Krull 's necklace . 
I 'm gonna have a few words with him . 
Hit me . 
Now all that 's left to do is settle my fee . 
The more action you take , the more progress you make . 
I 'm not in any hurry . 
Anything you wish , sir . 
Fits her better anyway . 
- Okay . 
Chiron , you must not let on a thing to Hebe .

He 's not gonna give me a shot like the doctors , is he ? 
Where is Bauer now ? 
Heh , yeah , you tell him I told him to shove it down his mother 's throat , the little punk bitch .

There are four of us but we are frightened of you . 
I have an army . 
What can I do for you ? 
It 's only bitter melon . 
i have something to tell you . 
This one . 
Finally . 
If anything happens to Haqqani , 
We need to find someplace safe . 
It doesn 't hurt . 
But Poul just wasn 't funny . 
What are we supposed to do ? 
We will have to help each other out . 
What do you think he meant by that ? 
I 'm sorry for your loss . 
You grow apart . 
You must 've half expected this day to come . 
Ruth , why aren 't you driving ? 
You have neither the training nor the intellect to conceive a drug as complex as Aterna . 
Scroll back , please . 
It 's easy to spook a boat . 
It 's like we stepped inside the mind of an asshole . 
Excuse me for one sec . 
Wait a minute ! 
Since the earthquake . 
What do you mean ? 
And I 'm hoping I 'll be hosting the first reunion meeting of the NLD . 
I needed to see you in person . 
I think that went well . 
You barely said a word the whole time . 
Which I imagine is , get take out and watch All About Eve , again . 
Don 't hate me 
Up . 
But this ain 't right . 
She 's got to be arthur 's daughter . 
I was hoping to ask you some questions about what you saw . 
In order to be chosen by the ring , it was said one must be without fear . 
Mr. President , I wish the pen were mightier than the sword , I do . 
- Do I have to explain the table of precedence again ? 
So we keep our options open . 
You wait for me here , I 'll be right back . 
Yes , you are . 
Thank you , Tim .

Her tactical sense is intuitive . 
But we can 't stay here . 
Will you stay until I fall asleep first ? 
- What ? 
- Negative . 
I 'd rather you kept your trousers on , if it 's all the same to you . 
Now he 's come to kill us . 
Sorry . 
Your species is smarter than you appear . 
You met her in the privacy room . 
Look at that , huh ? 
I hardly ever go to the same meeting twice . 
- Hey . 
And our altos . 
Why is the air off ? 
No offense intended . 
Not even in their specialty . 
It 's done . 
Sixteen ? 
I can fight if I have to . 
Anyway , he tells me go to hell .

It 's Kyle . 
It seems we have a seat to fill . 
Alright , good . 
- What direction were they heading ? 
Well , Teresa ... 
I 've got some antibiotics , medicine .

That 's why you protected him . 
If you tell us where the bomb is ... 
Fuck the virus ! 
Our emperor asks a favor from you . 
How is this possible ? 
That does not make it that wizard 's property . 
- Let me talk to you for a minute .

No . 
Our blood ties go back thousands of years .

Some guy who said he was a Congressman .

Valar morghulis . 
He wants to do this . 
I admired him . 
I understand . 
When I was eight ... 
All right , baby . 
It 's the same thing I just said . 
How about Carrie ? 
Because it would humiliate my wife , Senator . 
Just the insurance company . 
How did you get in ? 
No , you see , it 's more complicated than that . 
There 's still one life left we might be able to save . 
We dare to end this hunger for justice ! 
Go on . 
I 'm making super-special sure you 're always going to be okay . 
I hope to obtain pardon for my sins . 
Her lover lay in wait . 
How to get what I want .

Yeah , it was that . 
Have you forgotten Podtyolkov ? 
I want to know who killed that fsb agent as much ... 
I didn 't know ! 
Because of that kiss from you , I 'm up ten points in the polls today ! 
To call 911 . 
Out , 1 , 2 . 
Maybe because you 're screwing that twink trainer of yours . 
Stop , stop , stop . 
The country is peaceful . 
No , absolutely nothing . 
What ? 
Just get it ready . 
- Get it ? 
Mom 's the boss . 
and isn 't going to make it here tonight . 
My S-1 ! 
Kind of kid should be working for us . 
It 's someone we 've met before .

Once I give it to them , I 'll be no use to them . 
Command , we have visual on the Tribute Center . 
Are you sure ? 
The dagger . 
You 've clearly thought of everything . 
I 've noticed that about you . 
Oh , my God .

Excuse me . 
What have you seen and heard ? 
And Julia 's was mysterious . 
You stupid prawn ! 
We make bad choices .

Because of my past , I guess . 
Filled volumes with calculations . 
How much of this stuff that they expect us to make ? 
Carl , what the fuck ? 
Don 't let what get me down ? 
And your behavior can only lead to one conclusion . 
Me and Rob got into this huge , stupid fight last night . 
So how do we proceed now , Harold ? 
Okay ! 
Well , I 've already been stabbed once today . 
See , I knew you 'd wake up all boo-hooey . 
This 'll hurt her . 
Mom showed weakness ? 
- Of course . 
It 's new . 
- We go find her . 
And it 's headed towards the city . 
No , you 're not going by yourself . 
You 're saying he didn 't resist ? 
Keep your eyes on it .

I got a big crush on you , and I just can 't get a handle on it , so . 
Right in front of me . 
Okay , then what are we dealing with here ? 
She got a name ? 
No , but seriously . 
I just need a smoke so bad . 
So-so which is it ?

Then I must be well on my way to a successful recovery . 
I look forward to meeting Caspere . 
- I think he wants me to take a look . 
Oh , yeah . 
All those nice fingerprints on the car belong to the man it was stolen from . 
Just march up to his gates and tell him you 're crossing .

They 're the most fascinating , aren 't they ? 
You are irrelevant .

They destroyed our moon and with that , half the planet . 
Tate , what are you doing here ? 
About him breaking legs . 
We 're completely surrounded . 
There is no escape from this . 
That 's like seven hours from now . 
She didn 't commit suicide . 
I had my lumpectomy at this hospital . 
Now , you seem like a sweet girl . 
Told them all to fuck off .

The rip current dragged me under . 
Who leaves their door unlocked when they 're not home ? 
Okay , " Four walls build a home . "
